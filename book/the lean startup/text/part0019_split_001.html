<h2 id="c11-s01" class="section">BUILDING AN ADAPTIVE ORGANIZATION</h2>
		<p class="nonindent">Should a startup invest in a training program for new employees? If you had asked me a few years ago, I would have laughed and said, “Absolutely not. Training programs are for big companies that can afford them.” Yet at IMVU we wound up building a training program that was so good, new hires were productive on their first day of employment. Within just a few weeks, those employees were contributing at a high level. It required a huge effort to standardize our work processes and prepare a curriculum of the concepts that new employees should learn. Every new engineer would be assigned a mentor, who would help the new employee work through a curriculum of systems, concepts, and techniques he or she would need to become productive at IMVU. The performance of the mentor and mentee were linked, so the mentors took this education seriously.</p>
		<p class="indent">What is interesting, looking back at this example, is that we never stopped work and decided that we needed to build a great training program. Instead, the training program evolved organically out of a methodical approach to evolving our own <span id="page227"></span>process. This process of orientation was subject to constant experimentation and revision so that it grew more effective—and less burdensome—over time.</p>
		<p class="indent">I call this building an <i class="calibre2">adaptive organization</i>, one that automatically adjusts its process and performance to current conditions.</p>
		<h3 id="c11-s01-s01" class="section1">Can You Go Too Fast?</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">So far this book has emphasized the importance of speed. Startups are in a life-or-death struggle to learn how to build a sustainable business before they run out of resources and die. However, focusing on speed alone would be destructive. To work, startups require built-in speed regulators that help teams find their optimal pace of work.</p>
		<p class="indent">We saw an example of speed regulation in <a class="calibre6" href="part0017_split_000.html#G6PI0-16f7fd252de2444f946399bc54151cc5">Chapter 9</a> with the use of the <i class="calibre2">andon</i> cord in systems such as continuous deployment. It is epitomized in the paradoxical Toyota proverb, “Stop production so that production never has to stop.” The key to the <i class="calibre2">andon</i> cord is that it brings work to a stop as soon as an uncorrectable quality problem surfaces—which forces it to be investigated. This is one of the most important discoveries of the lean manufacturing movement: you cannot trade quality for time. If you are causing (or missing) quality problems now, the resulting defects will slow you down later. Defects cause a lot of rework, low morale, and customer complaints, all of which slow progress and eat away at valuable resources.</p>
		<p class="indent">So far I have used the language of physical products to describe these problems, but that is simply a matter of convenience. Service businesses have the same challenges. Just ask any manager of a training, staffing, or hospitality firm to show you the playbook that specifies how employees are supposed to deliver the service under various conditions. What might have started out as a simple guide tends to grow inexorably over time. <span id="page228"></span>Pretty soon, orientation is incredibly complex and employees have invested a lot of time and energy in learning the rules. Now consider an entrepreneurial manager in that kind of company trying to experiment with new rules or procedures. The higher-quality the existing playbook is, the easier it will be for it to evolve over time. By contrast, a low-quality playbook will be filled with contradictory or ambiguous rules that cause confusion when anything is changed.</p>
		<p class="indent">When I teach the Lean Startup approach to entrepreneurs with an engineering background, this is one of the hardest concepts to grasp. On the one hand, the logic of validated learning and the minimum viable product says that we should get a product into customers’ hands as soon as possible and that any extra work we do beyond what is required to learn from customers is waste. On the other hand, the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop is a continuous process. We don’t stop after one minimum viable product but use what we have learned to get to work immediately on the next iteration.</p>
		<p class="indent">Therefore, shortcuts taken in product quality, design, or infrastructure today may wind up slowing a company down tomorrow. You can see this paradox in action at IMVU. <a class="calibre6" href="part0009_split_000.html#8IL20-16f7fd252de2444f946399bc54151cc5">Chapter 3</a> recounted how we wound up shipping a product to customers that was full of bugs, missing features, and bad design. The customers wouldn’t even try that product, and so most of that work had to be thrown away. It’s a good thing we didn’t waste a lot of time fixing those bugs and cleaning up that early version.</p>
		<p class="indent">However, as our learning allowed us to build products that customers <i class="calibre2">did</i> want, we faced slowdowns. Having a low-quality product can inhibit learning when the defects prevent customers from experiencing (and giving feedback on) the product’s benefits. In IMVU’s case, as we offered the product to more mainstream customers, they were much less forgiving than early <span id="page229"></span>adopters had been. Similarly, the more features we added to the product, the harder it became to add even more because of the risk that a new feature would interfere with an existing feature. The same dynamics happen in a service business, since any new rules may conflict with existing rules, and the more rules, the more possibilities for conflict.</p>
		<p class="indent">IMVU used the techniques of this chapter to achieve scale and quality in a just-in-time fashion.</p>
