<h2 id="c03-s03" class="section">WHERE DO YOU FIND VALIDATION?</h2>
		<p class="nonindent">As I can attest, anybody who fails in a startup can claim that he or she has learned a lot from the experience. They can tell <span id="page50"></span>a compelling story. In fact, in the story of IMVU so far, you might have noticed something missing. Despite my claims that we learned a lot in those early months, lessons that led to our eventual success, I haven’t offered any evidence to back that up. In hindsight, it’s easy to make such claims and sound credible (and you’ll see some evidence later in the book), but imagine us in IMVU’s early months trying to convince investors, employees, family members, and most of all ourselves that we had not squandered our time and resources. What evidence did we have?</p>
		<p class="indent">Certainly our stories of failure were entertaining, and we had fascinating theories about what we had done wrong and what we needed to do to create a more successful product. However, the proof did not come until we put those theories into practice and built subsequent versions of the product that showed superior results with actual customers.</p>
		<p class="indent">The next few months are where the true story of IMVU begins, not with our brilliant assumptions and strategies and whiteboard gamesmanship but with the hard work of discovering what customers really wanted and adjusting our product and strategy to meet those desires. We adopted the view that our job was to find a synthesis between our vision and what customers would accept; it wasn’t to capitulate to what customers thought they wanted or to tell customers what they ought to want.</p>
		<p class="indent">As we came to understand our customers better, we were able to improve our products. As we did that, the fundamental metrics of our business changed. In the early days, despite our efforts to improve the product, our metrics were stubbornly flat. We treated each day’s customers as a new report card. We’d pay attention to the percentage of new customers who exhibited product behaviors such as downloading and buying our product. Each day, roughly the same number of customers would buy the product, and that number was pretty close to zero despite the many improvements.</p>
		<p class="indent"><span id="page51"></span>However, once we pivoted away from the original strategy, things started to change. Aligned with a superior strategy, our product development efforts became magically more productive—not because we were working harder but because we were working smarter, aligned with our customers’ real needs. Positive changes in metrics became the quantitative validation that our learning was real. This was critically important because we could show our stakeholders—employees, investors, and ourselves—that we were making genuine progress, not deluding ourselves. It is also the right way to think about productivity in a startup: not in terms of how much stuff we are building but in terms of how much validated learning we’re getting for our efforts.<a id="c03-nts004a" class="calibre6" href="part0025.html#c03-nts004"><sup class="frac">4</sup></a></p>
		<p class="indent">For example, in one early experiment, we changed our entire website, home page, and product registration flow to replace “avatar chat” with “3D instant messaging.” New customers were split automatically between these two versions of the site; half saw one, and half saw the other. We were able to measure the difference in behavior between the two groups. Not only were the people in the experimental group more likely to sign up for the product, they were more likely to become long-term paying customers.</p>
		<p class="indent">We had plenty of failed experiments too. During one period in which we believed that customers weren’t using the product because they didn’t understand its many benefits, we went so far as to pay customer service agents to act as virtual tour guides for new customers. Unfortunately, customers who got that VIP treatment were no more likely to become active or paying customers.</p>
		<p class="indent">Even after ditching the IM add-on strategy, it still took months to understand <i class="calibre2">why</i> it hadn’t worked. After our pivot and many failed experiments, we finally figured out this insight: customers wanted to use IMVU to make <i class="calibre2">new</i> friends online. Our <span id="page52"></span>customers intuitively grasped something that we were slow to realize. All the existing social products online were centered on customers’ real-life identity. IMVU’s avatar technology, however, was uniquely well suited to help people get to know each other online without compromising safety or opening themselves up to identity theft. Once we formed this hypothesis, our experiments became much more likely to produce positive results. Whenever we would change the product to make it easier for people to find and keep new friends, we discovered that customers were more likely to engage. This is true startup productivity: systematically figuring out the right things to build.</p>
		<p class="indent">These were just a few experiments among hundreds that we ran week in and week out as we started to learn which customers would use the product and why. Each bit of knowledge we gathered suggested new experiments to run, which moved our metrics closer and closer to our goal.</p>
