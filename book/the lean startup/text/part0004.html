		<p class="nonindent">Entrepreneurs are different in many ways, whether starting their own small company or inventing new products and businesses within a company like GE. But they also share certain traits. They are fast. They embrace new thinking. They are geared for disruption and innovation through uncertainty. One of the things I admire about Eric Ries’s The Lean Startup is its ability to teach anyone how to do this using a scientific approach.</p>
		<p class="indent">GE is all about constant reinvention. We iterate, innovate, and improve. Our culture embraces external thinking and invites cutting-edge practices. We do this working alongside great thinkers like Eric Ries, who help us improve the way we work.</p>
		<p class="indent">We are adding the principles of The Lean Startup to GE’s long tradition of continuous improvement, and across GE there are many projects where we are learning, iterating, and delivering outcomes in a new way. We call this new process FastWorks. Eric has been one of our advisers as we launched this tool to help us deliver better outcomes for our customers—quickly.</p>
		<p class="indent">For GE, these concepts accelerate impact, learning, improvement, and validation. GE’s founder, Thomas Edison, said he “readily absorbed ideas from every source,” and we’re continuing this tradition. Eric Ries is one of the people with great ideas helping us think about how a company like ours, operating at a massive scale, can be faster in everything we do, to bring more progress to our customers and to the world. I hope readers find as much inspiration and guidance in Eric’s book as GE has.</p>
