		<p class="nonindent"><span class="dropcaps">I</span><span class="big">n the past few years</span>, the Lean Startup movement has gone global. The number of resources available for aspiring entrepreneurs is incredible. Here, I’ll do my best to list just a few of the best events, books, and blogs for further reading and further practice. The rest is up to you. Reading is good, action is better.</p>
		<p class="indent">The most important resources are local. Gone are the days where you had to be in Silicon Valley to find other entrepreneurs to share ideas and struggles with. However, being embedded in a startup ecosystem is still an important part of entrepreneurship. What’s changed is that these ecosystems are springing up in more and more startup hubs around the world.</p>
		<p class="indent">I maintain an official website for <i class="calibre2">The Lean Startup</i> at <a class="calibre6" href="http://theleanstartup.com">http://theleanstartup.com</a>, where you can find additional resources, including case studies and links to further reading. You will also find links there to my blog, <i class="calibre2">Startup Lessons Learned</i>, as well as videos, slides, and audio from my past presentations.</p>
