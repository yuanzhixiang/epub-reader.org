<h2 id="c11-s04" class="section">THE FIVE WHYS IN ACTION</h2>
		<p class="nonindent">IGN Entertainment, a division of News Corporation, is an online video games media company with the biggest audience of video game players in the world. More than 45 million gamers frequent its portfolio of media properties. IGN was founded in the late 1990s, and News Corporation acquired it in 2005. IGN has grown to employ several hundred people, including almost a hundred engineers.</p>
		<p class="indent">Recently, I had the opportunity to speak to the product development team at IGN. They had been successful in recent years, but like all the established companies we’ve seen throughout this book, they were looking to accelerate new product development and find ways to be more innovative. They brought together their engineering, product, and design teams to talk through ways they could apply the Lean Startup model.</p>
		<p class="indent"><span id="page240"></span>This change initiative had the support of IGN’s senior management, including the CEO, the head of product development, the vice president of engineering, the publisher, and the head of product. Their previous efforts at Five Whys had not gone smoothly. They had attempted to tackle a laundry list of problem areas nominated by the product team. The issues varied from discrepancies in web analytics to partner data feeds that were not working. Their first Five Whys meeting took an hour, and although they came up with some interesting takeaways, as far as the Five Whys goes, it was a disaster. None of the people who were connected to and knew the most about the issues were at the meeting, and because this was the first time they were doing the Five Whys together, they didn’t stick to the format and went off on many tangents. It wasn’t a complete waste of time, but it didn’t have any of the benefits of the adaptive style of management discussed in this chapter.</p>
		<h3 id="c11-s04-s01" class="section1">Don’t Send Your Baggage through the Five Whys Process</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">IGN had the experience of trying to solve all of its “baggage” issues that had been causing wasted time for many years. Because this is an overwhelming set of problems, finding fixes quickly proves overwhelming.</p>
		<p class="indent">In their zeal to get started with the Five Whys, IGN neglected three important things:</p>
		<div class="block2">
			<p class="bl_hanging">1. To introduce Five Whys to an organization, it is necessary to hold Five Whys sessions as new problems come up. Since baggage issues are endemic, they naturally come up as part of the Five Whys analysis and you can take that opportunity to fix them incrementally. If they don’t come up organically, maybe they’re not as big as they seem.</p>
			<p class="bl_hanging">2. Everyone who is connected to a problem needs to be at the <span id="page241"></span>Five Whys session. Many organizations face the temptation to save time by sparing busy people from the root cause analysis. This is a false economy, as IGN discovered the hard way.</p>
			<p class="bl_hanging">3. At the beginning of each Five Whys session, take a few minutes to explain what the process is for and how it works for the benefit of those who are new to it. If possible, use an example of a successful Five Whys session from the past. If you’re brand new, you can use my earlier example about the manager who doesn’t believe in training. IGN learned that, whenever possible, it helps to use something that has personal meaning for the team.</p>
		</div>
		<p class="indent">After our meeting, the IGN leadership decided to give Five Whys another try. Following the advice laid out in this chapter, they appointed a Five Whys master named Tony Ford, a director of engineering. Tony was an entrepreneur who had come to IGN through an acquisition. He got his start with Internet technology, building websites about video games in the late 1990s. Eventually that led to an opportunity at a startup, TeamXbox, where he served as the lead software developer. TeamXbox was acquired by IGN Entertainment in 2003, and since that time Tony has been a technologist, leader of innovation, and proponent of agile and lean practices there.</p>
		<p class="indent">Unfortunately, Tony started without picking a narrow problem area on which to focus. This led to early setbacks and frustration. Tony relates, “As the new master I wasn’t very good at traversing through the Five Whys effectively, and the problems we were trying to solve were not great candidates in the first place. As you can imagine, these early sessions were awkward and in the end not very useful. I was getting quite discouraged and frustrated.” This is a common problem when one tries to tackle too much at once, but it is also a consequence of the fact <span id="page242"></span>that these skills take time to master. Luckily, Tony persevered: “Having a Five Whys master is critical in my opinion. Five Whys is easy in theory but difficult in practice, so you need someone who knows it well to shape the sessions for those who don’t.”</p>
		<p class="indent">The turnaround came when Tony led a Five Whys session involving a project that had been missing its deadlines. The session was fascinating and insightful and produced meaningful proportional investments. Tony explains: “The success had to do with a more experienced master and more experienced attendees. We all knew what the Five Whys was, and I did a really good job keeping us on track and away from tangents. This was a pivotal moment. Right then I knew the Five Whys was a new tool that was going to have a real impact on our overall success as a team and as a business.”</p>
		<p class="indent">On the surface, Five Whys seems to be about technical problems and preventing mistakes, but as teams drive out these superficial wastes, they develop a new understanding of how to work together. Tony put it this way: “I daresay that I discovered that the Five Whys transcends root cause analysis by revealing information that brings your team closer through a common understanding and perspective. A lot of times a problem can pull people apart; Five Whys does the opposite.”</p>
		<p class="indent">I asked Tony to provide an example of a recent successful Five Whys analysis from IGN. His account of it is listed in the sidebar.</p>

			<p class="textbox1"><b class="calibre1">Why couldn’t you add or edit posts on the blogs?</b></p>
			<p class="textbox1"><i class="calibre2">Answer:</i> Any post request (write) to the article content api was returning a 500 error.</p>
			<p class="textbox1"><i class="calibre2">Proportional investment:</i> Jim—We’ll work on the API, but let’s make our CMS more forgiving for the user. Allow users to add and edit drafts without errors for a better user experience.</p>
			<p class="extract"><span id="page243"></span><b class="calibre1">Why was the content API returning 500 errors?</b></p>
			<p class="textbox1"><i class="calibre2">Answer:</i> The bson_ext gem was incompatible with other gems it depends upon.</p>
			<p class="textbox1"><i class="calibre2">Proportional investment:</i> King—Remove the gem (already done to resolve the outage).</p>
			<p class="extract"><b class="calibre1">Why was the gem incompatible?</b></p>
			<p class="textbox1"><i class="calibre2">Answer:</i> We added a new version of the gem in addition to the existing version and the app started using it unexpectedly.</p>
			<p class="textbox1"><i class="calibre2">Proportional investment:</i> Bennett—Convert our rails app to use bundler for gem management.</p>
			<p class="extract"><b class="calibre1">Why did we add a new version of a gem in production without testing?</b></p>
			<p class="textbox1"><i class="calibre2">Answer:</i> We didn’t think we needed a test in these cases.</p>
			<p class="textbox1"><i class="calibre2">Proportional investment:</i> Bennett and Jim—Write a unit or functional test in the API and CMS that will catch this in the future.</p>
			<p class="extract"><b class="calibre1">Why do we add additional gems that we don’t intend to use right away?</b></p>
			<p class="textbox1"><i class="calibre2">Answer:</i> In preparation for a code push we wanted to get all new gems ready in the production environment. Even though our code deployments are fully automated, gems are not.</p>
			<p class="textbox1"><i class="calibre2">Proportional investment:</i> Bennett—Automate gem management and installation into Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment process.</p>
			<p class="extract"><b class="calibre1">Bonus—Why are we doing things in production on Friday nights?</b></p>
			<p class="textbox1"><i class="calibre2">Answer:</i> Because no one says we can’t and it was a convenient <span id="page244"></span>time for the developer to prepare for a deployment we’d be doing on Monday.</p>
			<p class="extract"><i class="calibre2">Proportional investment:</i> Tony—Make an announcement to the team. There will be no production changes on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday unless an exception has been made and approved by David (VP Engineering). We will reevaluate this policy when we have a fully automated continuous deployment process in place.</p>
			<p class="extract">As a result of this Five Whys session and the proportional investments we made, our deployments are easier, quicker, and never again will our process allow a developer to place gems into production systems with unintended consequences. Indeed, we have not had another issue like this. We strengthened our “cluster immune system” as you would say.</p>
			<p class="textbox2">Without the Five Whys, we would have never discovered all of the information we did here. My guess is that we would have told that one developer to not do stupid things on Friday nights and moved on. This is what I emphasized earlier, where a good Five Whys session has two outputs, learning and doing. The proportional investments that came out of this session are obviously valuable, but the learnings are much more subtle, but amazing for growing as developers and as a team.</p>
