<h2 id="c13-s03" class="section">IN CONCLUSION</h2>
		<p class="nonindent">As a movement, the Lean Startup must avoid doctrines and rigid ideology. We must avoid the caricature that science means formula or a lack of humanity in work. In fact, science is one of humanity’s most creative pursuits. I believe that applying it to entrepreneurship will unlock a vast storehouse of human potential.</p>
		<p class="indent">What would an organization look like if all of its employees were armed with Lean Startup organizational superpowers?</p>
		<p class="indent">For one thing, everyone would insist that assumptions be stated explicitly and tested rigorously not as a stalling tactic or a form of make-work but out of a genuine desire to discover the truth that underlies every project’s vision.</p>
		<p class="indent">We would not waste time on endless arguments between the defenders of quality and the cowboys of reckless advance; <span id="page284"></span>instead, we would recognize that speed and quality are allies in the pursuit of the customer’s long-term benefit. We would race to test our vision but not to abandon it. We would look to eliminate waste not to build quality castles in the sky but in the service of agility and breakthrough business results.</p>
		<p class="indent">We would respond to failures and setbacks with honesty and learning, not with recriminations and blame. More than that, we would shun the impulse to slow down, increase batch size, and indulge in the curse of prevention. Instead, we would achieve speed by bypassing the excess work that does not lead to learning. We would dedicate ourselves to the creation of new institutions with a long-term mission to build sustainable value and change the world for the better.</p>
		<p class="indent">Most of all, we would stop wasting people’s time.</p>
