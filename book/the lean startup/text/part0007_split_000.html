		<p class="nonindent"><span class="dropcaps">B</span><span class="big">uilding a startup is an</span> exercise in institution building; thus, it necessarily involves management. This often comes as a surprise to aspiring entrepreneurs, because their associations with these two words are so diametrically opposed. Entrepreneurs are rightly wary of implementing traditional management practices early on in a startup, afraid that they will invite bureaucracy or stifle creativity.</p>
		<p class="indent">Entrepreneurs have been trying to fit the square peg of their unique problems into the round hole of general management for decades. As a result, many entrepreneurs take a “just do it” attitude, avoiding all forms of management, process, and discipline. Unfortunately, this approach leads to chaos more often than it does to success. I should know: my first startup failures were all of this kind.</p>
		<p class="indent">The tremendous success of general management over the last century has provided unprecedented material abundance, but those management principles are ill suited to handle the chaos and uncertainty that startups must face.</p>
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/00009.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
		<p class="nonindent"><span id="page16"></span>I believe that entrepreneurship requires a managerial discipline to harness the entrepreneurial opportunity we have been given.</p>
		<p class="indent">There are more entrepreneurs operating today than at any previous time in history. This has been made possible by dramatic changes in the global economy. To cite but one example, one often hears commentators lament the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States over the previous two decades, but one rarely hears about a corresponding loss of manufacturing capability. That’s because total manufacturing output in the United States is <i class="calibre2">increasing</i> (by 15 percent in the last decade) even as jobs continue to be lost (see the charts below). In effect, the huge productivity increases made possible by modern management and technology have created more productive capacity than firms know what to do with.<a id="c01-nts001a" class="calibre6" href="part0025.html#c01-nts001"><sup class="frac">1</sup></a></p>
		<p class="indent">We are living through an unprecedented worldwide entrepreneurial renaissance, but this opportunity is laced with peril. <span id="page17"></span><span id="page18"></span>Because we lack a coherent management paradigm for new innovative ventures, we’re throwing our excess capacity around with wild abandon. Despite this lack of rigor, we are finding some ways to make money, but for every success there are far too many failures: products pulled from shelves mere weeks after being launched, high-profile startups lauded in the press and forgotten a few months later, and new products that wind up being used by nobody. What makes these failures particularly painful is not just the economic damage done to individual employees, companies, and investors; they are also a colossal waste of our civilization’s most precious resource: the time, passion, and skill of its people. The Lean Startup movement is dedicated to preventing these failures.</p>
