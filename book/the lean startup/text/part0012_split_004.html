<h2 id="c05-s04" class="section">ANALYSIS PARALYSIS</h2>
		<p class="nonindent">There are two ever-present dangers when entrepreneurs conduct market research and talk to customers. Followers of the just-do-it school of entrepreneurship are impatient to get started and don’t want to spend time analyzing their strategy. They’d rather start building immediately, often after just a few cursory customer conversations. Unfortunately, because customers don’t really know what they want, it’s easy for these entrepreneurs to delude themselves that they are on the right path.</p>
		<p class="indent">Other entrepreneurs can fall victim to analysis paralysis, <span id="page91"></span>endlessly refining their plans. In this case, talking to customers, reading research reports, and whiteboard strategizing are all equally unhelpful. The problem with most entrepreneurs’ plans is generally not that they don’t follow sound strategic principles but that the facts upon which they are based are wrong. Unfortunately, most of these errors cannot be detected at the whiteboard because they depend on the subtle interactions between products and customers.</p>
		<p class="indent">If too much analysis is dangerous but none can lead to failure, how do entrepreneurs know when to stop analyzing and start building? The answer is a concept called the minimum viable product, the subject of <a class="calibre6" href="part0013_split_000.html#CCNA0-16f7fd252de2444f946399bc54151cc5">Chapter 6</a>.</p>
