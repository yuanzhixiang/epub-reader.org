<h2 id="c11-s05" class="section">ADAPTING TO SMALLER BATCHES</h2>
		<p class="nonindent">Before leaving the topic of building an adaptive organization, I want to introduce one more story. This one concerns a product that you’ve probably used if you’ve ever run your own business. It’s called QuickBooks, and it is one of Intuit’s flagship products.</p>
		<p class="indent"><span id="page245"></span>QuickBooks has been the leading product in its category for many years. As a result, it has a large and dedicated customer base, and Intuit expects it to contribute significantly to its bottom line. Like most personal computer (PC) software of the last two decades, QuickBooks has been launched on an annual cycle, in one giant batch. This was how it worked three years ago, when Greg Wright, the director of product marketing for QuickBooks, joined the team. As you can imagine, there were lots of existing processes in place to ensure a consistent product and an on-time release. The typical release approach was to spend significant up-front time to identify the customers’ need:</p>
		<div class="block1">
			<p class="bl_nonindent">Typically the first three to four months of each annual cycle was spent strategizing and planning, without building new features. Once a plan and milestones were established, the team would spend the next six to nine months building. This would culminate in a big launch, and then the team would get its first feedback on whether it had successfully delivered on customers’ needs at the end of the process.</p>
			<p class="bl_indent">So here was the time line: start process in September, first beta release is in June, second beta is in July. The beta is essentially testing to make sure it doesn’t crash people’s computers or cause them to lose their data—by that time in the process, only major bugs can be fixed. The design of the product itself is locked.</p>
		</div>
		<p class="indent">This is the standard “waterfall” development methodology that product development teams have used for years. It is a linear, large-batch system that relies for success on proper forecasting and planning. In other words, it is completely maladapted for today’s rapidly changing business environment.</p>
		<h3 id="c11-s05-s01" class="section1"><span id="page246"></span>Year One: Achieving Failure</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">Greg witnessed this breakdown in 2009, his first year on the QuickBooks team. That year, the company shipped an entirely new system in QuickBooks for online banking, one of its most important features. The team went through rounds of usability testing using mock-ups and nonfunctional prototypes, followed by significant beta testing using sample customer data. At the moment of the launch, everything looked good.</p>
		<p class="indent">The first beta release was in June, and customer feedback started coming in negative. Although customers were complaining, there wasn’t sufficient cause to stop the release because it was technically flawless—it didn’t crash computers. At that point, Greg was in a bind. He had no way of knowing how the feedback would translate to real customer behavior in the market. Were these just isolated complaints, or part of a widespread problem? He did know one thing for sure, though: that his team could not afford to miss the deadline.</p>
		<p class="indent">When the product finally shipped, the results were terrible. It took customers four to five times longer to reconcile their banking transactions than it had with the older version. In the end, Greg’s team had failed to deliver on the customer need they were trying to address (despite building the product to specification), and because the next release had to go through the same waterfall process, it took the team nine months to fix. This is a classic case of “achieving failure”—successfully executing a flawed plan.</p>
		<p class="indent">Intuit uses a tracking survey called the Net Promoter Score<a id="c11-nts002a" class="calibre6" href="part0025.html#c11-nts002"><sup class="frac">2</sup></a> to evaluate customer satisfaction with its many products. This is a great source of actionable metrics about what customers really think about a product. In fact, I used it at IMVU, too. One thing that is nice about NPS is that it is very stable over time. Since it is measuring core customer satisfaction, it is not subject to minor fluctuations; it registers only major changes in customer <span id="page247"></span>sentiment. That year, the QuickBooks score dropped 20 points, the first time the company had ever moved the needle with the Net Promoter Score. That 20-point drop resulted in significant losses for Intuit and was embarrassing for the company—all because customer feedback came too late in the process, allowing no time to iterate.</p>
		<p class="indent">Intuit’s senior management, including the general manager of the small business division and the head of small business accounting, recognized the need for change. To their credit, they tasked Greg with driving that change. His mission: to achieve startup speed for the development and deployment of QuickBooks.</p>
		<h3 id="c11-s05-s02" class="section1">Year Two: Muscle Memory</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">The next chapter of this story illustrates how hard it is to build an adaptive organization. Greg set out to change the QuickBooks development process by using four principles:</p>
		<div class="block2">
			<p class="bl_hanging">1. Smaller teams. Shift from large teams with uniform functional roles to smaller, fully engaged teams whose members take on different roles.</p>
			<p class="bl_hanging">2. Achieve shorter cycle times.</p>
			<p class="bl_hanging">3. Faster customer feedback, testing both whether it crashes customers’ computers and the performance of new features/customer experience.</p>
			<p class="bl_hanging">4. Enable and empower teams to make fast and courageous decisions.</p>
		</div>
		<p class="indent">On the surface, these goals seem to be aligned with the methods and principles described in previous chapters, but Greg’s second year with QuickBooks was not a marked success. For example, he decreed that the team would move to a midyear <span id="page248"></span>release milestone, effectively cutting the cycle time and batch size in half. However, this was not successful. Through sheer determination, the team tried valiantly to get an alpha release out in January. However, the problems that afflict large-batch development were still present, and the team struggled to complete the alpha by April. That represented an improvement over the past system because issues could be brought to the surface two months earlier than under the old way, but it did not produce the dramatically better results Greg was looking for.</p>
		<p class="indent">In fact, over the course of the year, the team’s process kept looking more and more like it had in prior years. As Greg put it, “Organizations have muscle memory,” and it is hard for people to unlearn old habits. Greg was running up against a system, and making individual changes such as arbitrarily changing the release date were no match for it.</p>
		<h3 id="c11-s05-s03" class="section1">Year Three: Explosion</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">Frustrated by the limited progress in the previous year, Greg teamed up with the product development leader Himanshu Baxi. Together they tossed out all the old processes. They made a public declaration that their combined teams would be creating new processes and that they were not going to go back to the old way.</p>
		<p class="indent">Instead of focusing on new deadlines, Greg and Himanshu invested in process, product, and technology changes that enabled working in smaller batches. Those technical innovations helped them get the desktop product to customers faster for feedback. Instead of building a comprehensive road map at the beginning of the year, Greg kicked off the year with what they called idea/code/solution jams that brought engineers, product managers, and customers together to create a pipeline of ideas. It was scary for Greg as a product manager to start the year <span id="page249"></span>without a defined list of what would be in the product release, but he had confidence in his team and the new process.</p>
		<p class="indent">There were three differences in year three:</p>
		<div class="block2">
			<p class="bl_hanging">• Teams were involved in creating new technologies, processes, and systems.</p>
			<p class="bl_hanging">• Cross-functional teams were formed around new great ideas.</p>
			<p class="bl_hanging">• Customers were involved from the inception of each feature concept.</p>
		</div>
		<p class="indent">It’s important to understand that the old approach did not lack customer feedback or customer involvement in the planning process. In the true spirit of <i class="calibre2">genchi gembutsu</i>, Intuit product managers (PMs) would do “follow-me-homes” with customers to identify problems to solve in the next release. However, the PMs were responsible for all the customer research. They would bring it back to the team and say, “This is the problem we want to solve, and here are ideas for how we could solve it.”</p>
		<p class="indent">Changing to a cross-functional way of working was not smooth sailing. Some team members were skeptical. For example, some product managers felt that it was a waste of time for engineers to spend time in front of customers. The PMs thought that their job was to figure out the customer issue and define what needed to be built. Thus, the reaction of some PMs to the change was: “What’s my job? What am I supposed to be doing?” Similarly, some on the engineering side just wanted to be told what to do; they didn’t want to talk to customers. As is typically the case in large-batch development, both groups had been willing to sacrifice the team’s ability to learn in order to work more “efficiently.”</p>
		<p class="indent">Communication was critical for this change process to succeed. All the team leaders were open about the change they were <span id="page250"></span>driving and why they were driving it. Much of the skepticism they faced was based on the fact that they did not have concrete examples of where this had worked in the past; it was an entirely new process for Intuit. They had to explain clearly why the old process didn’t work and why the annual release “train” was not setting them up for success. Throughout the change they communicated the process outcomes they were shooting for: earlier customer feedback and a faster development cycle that was decoupled from the annual release time line. They repeatedly emphasized that the new approach was how startup competitors were working and iterating. They had to follow suit or risk becoming irrelevant.</p>
		<p class="center"><img src="../images/00009.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre5"/></p>
		<p class="nonindent">Historically, QuickBooks had been built with large teams and long cycle times. For example, in earlier years the ill-fated online banking team had been composed of fifteen engineers, seven quality assurance specialists, a product manager, and at times more than one designer. Now no team is bigger than five people. The focus of each team is iterating with customers as rapidly as possible, running experiments, and then using validated learning to make real-time investment decisions about what to work on. As a result, whereas they used to have five major “branches” of QuickBooks that merged features at the time of the launch, now there are twenty to twenty-five branches. This allows for a much larger set of experiments. Each team works on a new feature for approximately six weeks end to end, testing it with real customers throughout the process.</p>
		<p class="indent">Although the primary changes that are required in an adaptive organization are in the mind-set of its employees, changing the culture is not sufficient. As we saw in <a class="calibre6" href="part0017_split_000.html#G6PI0-16f7fd252de2444f946399bc54151cc5">Chapter 9</a>, lean management requires treating work as a system and then dealing with the batch size and cycle time of the whole process. Thus, <span id="page251"></span>to achieve lasting change, the QuickBooks team had to invest in tools and platform changes that would enable the new, faster way of working.</p>
		<p class="indent">For example, one of the major stress points in the attempt to release an early alpha version the previous year was that QuickBooks is a mission-critical product. Many small businesses use it as their primary repository for critical financial data. The team was extremely wary of releasing a minimum viable product that had any risk of corrupting customer data. Therefore, even if they worked in smaller teams with a smaller scope, the burden of all that risk would have made it hard to work in smaller batches.</p>
		<p class="indent">To get the batch size down, the QuickBooks team had to invest in new technology. They built a virtualization system that allowed them to run multiple versions of QuickBooks on a customer’s computer. The second version could access all the customer’s data but could not make permanent changes to it. Thus, there was no risk of the new version corrupting the customer’s data by accident. This allowed them to isolate new releases to allow selected real customers to test them and provide feedback.</p>
		<p class="indent">The results in year three were promising. The version of QuickBooks that shipped that year had significantly higher customer satisfaction ratings and sold more units. If you’re using QuickBooks right now, odds are you are using a version that was built in small batches. As Greg heads into his fourth year with the QuickBooks team, they are exploring even more ways to drive down batch size and cycle time. As usual, there are possibilities that go beyond technical solutions. For example, the annual sales cycle of boxed desktop software is a significant barrier to truly rapid learning, and so the team has begun experimenting with subscription-based products for the most active customers. With customers downloading updates online, Intuit can release software on a more frequent basis. Soon this program will see the QuickBooks team releasing to customers quarterly.<a id="c11-nts003a" class="calibre6" href="part0025.html#c11-nts003"><sup class="frac">3</sup></a></p>

		<p class="nonindent">As Lean Startups grow, they can use adaptive techniques to develop more complex processes without giving up their core advantage: speed through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. In fact, one of the primary benefits of using techniques that are derived from lean manufacturing is that Lean Startups, when they grow up, are well positioned to develop operational excellence based on lean principles. They already know how to operate with discipline, develop processes that are tailor-made to their situation, and use lean techniques such as the Five Whys and small batches. As a successful startup makes the transition to an established company, it will be well poised to develop the kind of culture of disciplined execution that characterizes the world’s best firms, such as Toyota.</p>
		<p class="indent">However, successfully growing into an established company is not the end of the story. A startup’s work is never done, because as was discussed in <a class="calibre6" href="part0008_split_000.html#7K4G0-16f7fd252de2444f946399bc54151cc5">Chapter 2</a>, even established companies must struggle to find new sources of growth through disruptive innovation. This imperative is coming earlier in companies’ lives. No longer can a successful startup expect to have years after its initial public offering to bask in market-leading success. Today successful companies face immediate pressure from new competitors, fast followers, and scrappy startups. As a result, it no longer makes sense to think of startups as going through discrete phases like the proverbial metamorphosis of a caterpillar to a butterfly. Both successful startups and established companies alike must learn to juggle multiple kinds of work at the same time, pursuing operational excellence <i class="calibre2">and</i> disruptive innovation. This requires a new kind of portfolio thinking, which is the subject of <a class="calibre6" href="part0020_split_000.html#J2B80-16f7fd252de2444f946399bc54151cc5">Chapter 12</a>.</p>
