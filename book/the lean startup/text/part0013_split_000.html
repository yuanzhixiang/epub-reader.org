		<p class="nonindent"><span class="dropcaps">G</span><span class="big">roupon is one of the</span> fastest-growing companies of all time. Its name comes from “group coupons,” an ingenious idea that has spawned an entire industry of social commerce imitators. However, it didn’t start out successful. When customers took Groupon up on its first deal, a whopping twenty people bought two-for-one pizza in a restaurant on the first floor of the company’s Chicago offices—hardly a world-changing event.</p>
		<p class="indent">In fact, Groupon wasn’t originally meant to be about commerce at all. The founder, Andrew Mason, intended his company to become a “collective activism platform” called The Point. Its goal was to bring people together to solve problems they couldn’t solve on their own, such as fund-raising for a cause or boycotting a certain retailer. The Point’s early results were disappointing, however, and at the end of 2008 the founders decided to try something new. Although they still had grand ambitions, they were determined to keep the new product simple. They built a minimum viable product. Does this sound like a billion-dollar company to you? Mason tells the story:</p>
		<div class="block1">
			<p class="bl_nonindent">We took a WordPress Blog and we skinned it to say Groupon and then every day we would do a new post. We would sell T-shirts on the first <span id="page93"></span>version of Groupon. We’d say in the write-up, “This T-shirt will come in the color red, size large. If you want a different color or size, e-mail that to us.” We didn’t have a form to add that stuff. It was just so cobbled together.</p>
			<p class="bl_indent">It was enough to prove the concept and show that it was something that people really liked. The actual coupon generation that we were doing was all FileMaker. We would run a script that would e-mail the coupon PDF to people. It got to the point where we’d sell 500 sushi coupons in a day, and we’d send 500 PDFs to people with Apple Mail at the same time. Really until July of the first year it was just a scrambling to grab the tiger by the tail. It was trying to catch up and reasonably piece together a product.<a id="c06-nts001a" class="calibre6" href="part0025.html#c06-nts001"><sup class="frac">1</sup></a></p>
		</div>
		<p class="indent">Handmade PDFs, a pizza coupon, and a simple blog were enough to launch Groupon into record-breaking success; it is on pace to become the fastest company in history to achieve $1 billion in sales. It is revolutionizing the way local businesses find new customers, offering special deals to consumers in more than 375 cities worldwide.<a id="c06-nts002a" class="calibre6" href="part0025.html#c06-nts002"><sup class="frac">2</sup></a></p>

		<p class="nonindent">A minimum viable product (MVP) helps entrepreneurs start the process of learning as quickly as possible.<a id="c06-nts003a" class="calibre6" href="part0025.html#c06-nts003"><sup class="frac">3</sup></a> It is not necessarily the smallest product imaginable, though; it is simply the fastest way to get through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop with the minimum amount of effort.</p>
		<p class="indent">Contrary to traditional product development, which usually involves a long, thoughtful incubation period and strives for product perfection, the goal of the MVP is to begin the process of learning, not end it. Unlike a prototype or concept test, an <span id="page94"></span>MVP is designed not just to answer product design or technical questions. Its goal is to test fundamental business hypotheses.</p>
