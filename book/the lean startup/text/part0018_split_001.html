<h2 id="c10-s01" class="section">WHERE DOES GROWTH COME FROM?</h2>
		<p class="nonindent">The engine of growth is the mechanism that startups use to achieve sustainable growth. I use the word <i class="calibre2">sustainable</i> to exclude all one-time activities that generate a surge of customers but have no long-term impact, such as a single advertisement or a publicity stunt that might be used to jump-start growth but could not sustain that growth for the long term.</p>
		<p class="indent">Sustainable growth is characterized by one simple rule:</p>
		<div class="block1">
			<p class="bl_nonindent"><i class="calibre2">New customers come from the actions of past customers</i>.</p>
		</div>
		<p class="indent">There are four primary ways past customers drive sustainable growth:</p>
		<p class="indent"><span id="page208"></span><b class="calibre1">1. Word of mouth</b>. Embedded in most products is a natural level of growth that is caused by satisfied customers’ enthusiasm for the product. For example, when I bought my first TiVo DVR, I couldn’t stop telling my friends and family about it. Pretty soon, my entire family was using one.</p>
		<p class="extract1"><b class="calibre1">2. As a side effect of product usage</b>. Fashion or status, such as luxury goods products, drive awareness of themselves whenever they are used. When you see someone dressed in the latest clothes or driving a certain car, you may be influenced to buy that product. This is also true of so-called viral products such as Facebook and PayPal. When a customer sends money to a friend using PayPal, the friend is exposed automatically to the PayPal product.</p>
		<p class="extract1"><b class="calibre1">3. Through funded advertising</b>. Most businesses employ advertising to entice new customers to use their products. For this to be a source of sustainable growth, the advertising must be paid for out of revenue, not one-time sources such as investment capital. As long as the cost of acquiring a new customer (the so-called marginal cost) is less than the revenue that customer generates (the marginal revenue), the excess (the marginal profit) can be used to acquire more customers. The more marginal profit, the faster the growth.</p>
		<p class="extract1"><b class="calibre1">4. Through repeat purchase or use</b>. Some products are designed to be purchased repeatedly either through a subscription plan (a cable company) or through voluntary repurchases (groceries or lightbulbs). By contrast, many products and services are intentionally designed as one-time events, such as wedding planning.</p>
		<p class="extract">These sources of sustainable growth power feedback loops that I have termed <i class="calibre2">engines of growth</i>. Each is like a combustion engine, turning over and over. The faster the loop turns, the faster the <span id="page209"></span>company will grow. Each engine has an intrinsic set of metrics that determine how fast a company can grow when using it.</p>
