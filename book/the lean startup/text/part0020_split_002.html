<h2 id="c12-s02" class="section">CREATING A PLATFORM FOR EXPERIMENTATION</h2>
		<p class="nonindent">Next, it is important to focus on establishing the ground rules under which autonomous startup teams operate: how to protect the parent organization, how to hold entrepreneurial managers accountable, and how to reintegrate an innovation back into the parent organization if it is successful. Recall the “island of <span id="page257"></span>freedom” that enabled the SnapTax team—in <a class="calibre6" href="part0008_split_000.html#7K4G0-16f7fd252de2444f946399bc54151cc5">Chapter 2</a>—to successfully create a startup within Intuit. That’s what a platform for experimentation can do.</p>
		<h3 id="c12-s02-s01" class="section1">Protecting the Parent Organization</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">Conventionally, advice about internal innovators focuses on protecting the startup from the parent organization. I believe it is necessary to turn this model on its head.</p>
		<p class="indent">Let me begin by describing a fairly typical meeting from one of my consulting clients, a large company. Senior management had gathered to make decisions about what to include in the next version of its product. As part of the company’s commitment to being data-driven, it had tried to conduct an experiment on pricing. The first part of the meeting was taken up with interpreting the data from the experiment.</p>
		<p class="indent">One problem was that nobody could agree on what the data meant. Many custom reports had been created for the meeting; the data warehouse team was at the meeting too. The more they were asked to explain the details of each row on the spreadsheet, the more evident it became that nobody understood how those numbers had been derived. What we were left looking at was the number of gross sales of the product at a variety of different price points, broken down by quarter and by customer segment. It was a lot of data to try to comprehend.</p>
		<p class="indent">Worse, nobody was sure which customers had been exposed to the experiment. Different teams had been responsible for implementing it, and so different parts of the product had been updated at different times. The whole process had taken many months, and by this point, the people who had conceived the experiment had been moved to a division separate from that of the people who had executed it.</p>
		<p class="indent">You should be able to spot the many problems with this <span id="page258"></span>situation: the use of vanity metrics instead of actionable metrics, an overly long cycle time, the use of large batch sizes, an unclear growth hypothesis, a weak experimental design, a lack of team ownership, and therefore very little learning.</p>
		<p class="indent">Listening in, I assumed this would be the end of the meeting. With no agreed-on facts to help make the decision, I thought nobody would have any basis for making the case for a particular action. I was wrong. Each department simply took whatever interpretation of the data supported its position best and started advocating on its own behalf. Other departments would chime in with alternative interpretations that supported their positions, and so on. In the end, decisions were not made based on data. Instead, the executive running the meeting was forced to base decisions on the most plausible-sounding arguments.</p>
		<p class="indent">It seemed wasteful to me how much of the meeting had been spent debating the data because, in the end, the arguments that carried the day could have been made right at the start. It was as if each advocate sensed that he or she was about to be ambushed; if another team managed to bring clarity to the situation, it might undermine that person, and so the rational response was to obfuscate as much as possible. What a waste.</p>
		<p class="indent">Ironically, meetings like this had given data-driven decision making and experimentation a bad name inside the company, and for good reason. The data warehousing team was producing reports that nobody read or understood. The project teams felt the experiments were a waste of time, since they involved building features halfway, which meant they were never any good. “Running an experiment” seemed to them to be code for postponing a hard decision. Worst of all, the executive team experienced the meetings as chronic headaches. Their old product prioritization meetings might have been little more than a battle of opinions, but at least the executives understood what was going on. Now they had to go through a ritual that involved <span id="page259"></span>complex math and reached no definite outcome, and then they ended up having a battle of opinions anyway.</p>
		<h3 id="c12-s02-s02" class="section1">Rational Fears</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">However, at the heart of this departmental feud was a very rational fear. This company served two customer segments: a business-to-business enterprise segment and a consumer segment. In the B2B segment, the company employed sales staff to sell large volumes of the product to other companies, whereas the consumer segment was driven mostly by one-off purchases made by individuals. The bulk of the company’s current revenue came from B2B sales, but growth in that segment had been slowing. Everyone agreed there was tremendous potential for growth in the consumer segment, but so far little had materialized.</p>
		<p class="indent">Part of the cause of this lack of growth was the current pricing structure. Like many companies that sell to large enterprises, this one published a high list price and then provided heavy discounts to “favored” corporate clients who bought in bulk. Naturally, every salesperson was encouraged to make all of his or her clients feel favored. Unfortunately, the published list price was much too high for the consumer segment.</p>
		<p class="indent">The team in charge of growing the consumer segment wanted to run experiments with a lower price structure. The team in charge of the enterprise segment was nervous that this would cannibalize or otherwise diminish its existing relationships with its customers. What if those customers discovered that individuals were getting a lower price than they were?</p>
		<p class="indent">Anyone who has been in a multisegment business will recognize that there are many possible solutions to this problem, such as creating tiered feature sets so that different customers are able to purchase different “levels” of the product (as in airline seating) or even supporting different products under separate <span id="page260"></span>brand names. Yet the company was struggling to implement any of those solutions. Why? Out of fear of endangering the current business, each proposed experiment would be delayed, sabotaged, and obfuscated.</p>
		<p class="indent">It’s important to emphasize that this fear is well founded. Sabotage is a rational response from managers whose territory is threatened. This company is not a random, tiny startup with nothing to lose. An established company has a lot to lose. If the revenue from the core business goes down, heads will roll. This is not something to be taken lightly.</p>
		<h3 id="c12-s02-s03" class="section1">The Dangers of Hiding Innovation inside the Black Box</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">The imperative to innovate is unrelenting. Without the ability to experiment in a more agile manner, this company eventually would suffer the fate described in <i class="calibre2">The Innovator’s Dilemma:</i> ever-higher profits and margins year after year until the business suddenly collapsed.</p>
		<p class="indent">We often frame internal innovation challenges by asking, How can we protect the internal startup from the parent organization? I would like to reframe and reverse the question: How can we protect the parent organization from the startup? In my experience, people defend themselves when they feel threatened, and no innovation can flourish if defensiveness is given free rein. In fact, this is why the common suggestion to hide the innovation team is misguided. There are examples of one-time successes using a secret skunkworks or off-site innovation team, such as the building of the original IBM PC in Boca Raton, Florida, completely separate from mainline IBM. But these examples should serve mostly as cautionary tales, because they have rarely led to sustainable innovation.<a id="c12-nts002a" class="calibre6" href="part0025.html#c12-nts002"><sup class="frac">2</sup></a> Hiding from the parent organization can have long-term negative consequences.</p>
		<p class="indent"><span id="page261"></span>Consider it from the point of view of the managers who have the innovation sprung on them. They are likely to feel betrayed and more than a little paranoid. After all, if something of this magnitude could be hidden, what else is waiting in the shadows? Over time, this leads to more politics as managers are incentivized to ferret out threats to their power, influence, and careers. The fact that the innovation was a success is no justification for this dishonest behavior. From the point of view of established managers, the message is clear: if you are not on the inside, you are liable to be blindsided by this type of secret.</p>
		<p class="indent">It is unfair to criticize these managers for their response; the criticism should be aimed at senior executives who failed to design a supportive system in which to operate and innovate. I believe this is one reason why companies such as IBM lost their leadership position in the new markets that they developed using a black box such as the PC business; they are unable to re-create and sustain the culture that led to the innovation in the first place.</p>
		<h3 id="c12-s02-s04" class="section1">Creating an Innovation Sandbox</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">The challenge here is to create a mechanism for empowering innovation teams out in the open. This is the path toward a sustainable culture of innovation over time as companies face repeated existential threats. My suggested solution is to create a sandbox for innovation that will contain the impact of the new innovation but not constrain the methods of the startup team. It works as follows:</p>
		<div class="block2">
			<p class="bl_hanging">1. Any team can create a true split-test experiment that affects only the sandboxed parts of the product or service (for a multipart product) or only certain customer segments or territories (for a new product). However:</p>
			<p class="bl_hanging"><span id="page262"></span>2. One team must see the whole experiment through from end to end.</p>
			<p class="bl_hanging">3. No experiment can run longer than a specified amount of time (usually a few weeks for simple feature experiments, longer for more disruptive innovations).</p>
			<p class="bl_hanging">4. No experiment can affect more than a specified number of customers (usually expressed as a percentage of the company’s total mainstream customer base).</p>
			<p class="bl_hanging">5. Every experiment has to be evaluated on the basis of a single standard report of five to ten (no more) actionable metrics.</p>
			<p class="bl_hanging">6. Every team that works inside the sandbox and every product that is built must use the same metrics to evaluate success.</p>
			<p class="bl_hanging">7. Any team that creates an experiment must monitor the metrics and customer reactions (support calls, social media reaction, forum threads, etc.) while the experiment is in progress and abort it if something catastrophic happens.</p>
		</div>
		<p class="indent">At the beginning, the sandbox has to be quite small. In the company above, the sandbox initially contained only the pricing page. Depending on the types of products the company makes, the size of the sandbox can be defined in different ways. For example, an online service might restrict it to certain pages or user flows. A retail operation might restrict it to certain stores or geographic areas. Companies trying to bring an entirely new product to market might build the restriction around customers in certain segments.</p>
		<p class="indent">Unlike in a concept test or market test, customers in the sandbox are considered real and the innovation team is allowed to attempt to establish a long-term relationship with them. After <span id="page263"></span>all, they may be experimenting with those early adopters for a long time before their learning milestones are accomplished.</p>
		<p class="indent">Whenever possible, the innovation team should be cross-functional and have a clear team leader, like the Toyota <i class="calibre2">shusa</i>. It should be empowered to build, market, and deploy products or features in the sandbox without prior approval. It should be required to report on the success or failure of those efforts by using standard actionable metrics and innovation accounting.</p>
		<p class="indent">This approach can work even for teams that have never before worked cross-functionally. The first few changes, such as a price change, may not require great engineering effort, but they require coordination across departments: engineering, marketing, customer service. Teams that work this way are more productive as long as productivity is measured by their ability to create customer value and not just stay busy.</p>
		<p class="indent">True experiments are easy to classify as successes or failures because top-level metrics either move or they don’t. Either way, the team learns immediately whether its assumptions about how customers will behave are correct. By using the same metrics each time, the team builds literacy about those metrics across the company. Because the innovation team is reporting on its progress by using the system of innovation accounting described in <a class="calibre6" href="part0011_split_000.html#AFM60-16f7fd252de2444f946399bc54151cc5">Part Two</a>, anyone who reads those reports is getting an implicit lesson in the power of actionable metrics. This effect is extremely powerful. Even if someone wants to sabotage the innovation team, he or she will have to learn all about actionable metrics and learning milestones to do it.</p>
		<p class="indent">The sandbox also promotes rapid iteration. When people have a chance to see a project through from end to end and the work is done in small batches and delivers a clear verdict quickly, they benefit from the power of feedback. Each time they fail to move the numbers, they have a real opportunity <span id="page264"></span>to act on their findings immediately. Thus, these teams tend to converge on optimal solutions rapidly even if they start out with really bad ideas.</p>
		<p class="indent">As we saw earlier, this is a manifestation of the principle of small batches. Functional specialists, especially those steeped in waterfall or stage-gate development, have been trained to work in extremely large batches. This causes even good ideas to get bogged down by waste. By making the batch size small, the sandbox method allows teams to make cheap mistakes quickly and start learning. As we’ll see below, these small initial experiments can demonstrate that a team has a viable new business that can be integrated back into the parent company.</p>
		<h3 id="c12-s02-s05" class="section1">Holding Internal Teams Accountable</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">We already discussed learning milestones in detail in <a class="calibre6" href="part0014_split_000.html#DB7S0-16f7fd252de2444f946399bc54151cc5">Chapter 7</a>. With an internal startup team, the sequence of accountability is the same: build an ideal model of the desired disruption that is based on customer archetypes, launch a minimum viable product to establish a baseline, and then attempt to tune the engine to get it closer to the ideal.</p>
		<p class="indent">Operating in this framework, internal teams essentially act as startups. As they demonstrate success, they need to become integrated into the company’s overall portfolio of products and services.</p>
