<h2 id="c08-s06" class="section">A CATALOG OF PIVOTS</h2>
		<p class="nonindent">Pivots come in different flavors. The word <i class="calibre2">pivot</i> sometimes is used incorrectly as a synonym for <i class="calibre2">change</i>. A pivot is a special <span id="page173"></span>kind of change designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, business model, and engine of growth.</p>
		<h3 id="c08-s06-s01" class="section1">Zoom-in Pivot</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">In this case, what previously was considered a single feature in a product becomes the whole product. This is the type of pivot Votizen made when it pivoted away from a full social network and toward a simple voter contact product.</p>
		<h3 id="c08-s06-s02" class="section1">Zoom-out Pivot</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">In the reverse situation, sometimes a single feature is insufficient to support a whole product. In this type of pivot, what was considered the whole product becomes a single feature of a much larger product.</p>
		<h3 id="c08-s06-s03" class="section1">Customer Segment Pivot</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">In this pivot, the company realizes that the product it is building solves a real problem for real customers but that they are not the type of customers it originally planned to serve. In other words, the product hypothesis is partially confirmed, solving the right problem, but for a different customer than originally anticipated.</p>
		<h3 id="c08-s06-s04" class="section1">Customer Need Pivot</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">As a result of getting to know customers extremely well, it sometimes becomes clear that the problem we’re trying to solve for them is not very important. However, because of this customer intimacy, we often discover other related problems that are <span id="page174"></span>important and can be solved by our team. In many cases, these related problems may require little more than repositioning the existing product. In other cases, it may require a completely new product. Again, this is a case where the product hypothesis is partially confirmed; the target customer has a problem worth solving, just not the one that was originally anticipated.</p>
		<p class="indent">A famous example is the chain Potbelly Sandwich Shop, which today has over two hundred stores. It began as an antique store in 1977; the owners started to sell sandwiches as a way to bolster traffic to their stores. Pretty soon they had pivoted their way into an entirely different line of business.</p>
		<h3 id="c08-s06-s05" class="section1">Platform Pivot</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">A platform pivot refers to a change from an application to a platform or vice versa. Most commonly, startups that aspire to create a new platform begin life by selling a single application, the so-called killer app, for their platform. Only later does the platform emerge as a vehicle for third parties to leverage as a way to create their own related products. However, this order is not always set in stone, and some companies have to execute this pivot multiple times.</p>
		<h3 id="c08-s06-s06" class="section1">Business Architecture Pivot</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">This pivot borrows a concept from Geoffrey Moore, who observed that companies generally follow one of two major business architectures: high margin, low volume (complex systems model) or low margin, high volume (volume operations model).<a id="c08-nts006a" class="calibre6" href="part0025.html#c08-nts006"><sup class="frac">6</sup></a> The former commonly is associated with business to business (B2B) or enterprise sales cycles, and the latter with consumer products (there are notable exceptions). In a business architecture pivot, a startup switches architectures. Some companies <span id="page175"></span>change from high margin, low volume by going mass market (e.g., Google’s search “appliance”); others, originally designed for the mass market, turned out to require long and expensive sales cycles.</p>
		<h3 id="c08-s06-s07" class="section1">Value Capture Pivot</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">There are many ways to capture the value a company creates. These methods are referred to commonly as monetization or revenue models. These terms are much too limiting. Implicit in the idea of monetization is that it is a separate “feature” of a product that can be added or removed at will. In reality, capturing value is an intrinsic part of the product hypothesis. Often, changes to the way a company captures value can have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the business, product, and marketing strategies.</p>
		<h3 id="c08-s06-s08" class="section1">Engine of Growth Pivot</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">As we’ll see in <a class="calibre6" href="part0018_split_000.html#H5A40-16f7fd252de2444f946399bc54151cc5">Chapter 10</a>, there are three primary engines of growth that power startups: the viral, sticky, and paid growth models. In this type of pivot, a company changes its growth strategy to seek faster or more profitable growth. Commonly but not always, the engine of growth also requires a change in the way value is captured.</p>
		<h3 id="c08-s06-s09" class="section1">Channel Pivot</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">In traditional sales terminology, the mechanism by which a company delivers its product to customers is called the sales channel or distribution channel. For example, consumer packaged goods are sold in a grocery store, cars are sold in dealerships, and much enterprise software is sold (with extensive customization) by <span id="page176"></span>consulting and professional services firms. Often, the requirements of the channel determine the price, features, and competitive landscape of a product. A channel pivot is a recognition that the same basic solution could be delivered through a different channel with greater effectiveness. Whenever a company abandons a previously complex sales process to “sell direct” to its end users, a channel pivot is in progress.</p>
		<p class="indent">It is precisely because of its destructive effect on sales channels that the Internet has had such a disruptive influence in industries that previously required complex sales and distribution channels, such as newspaper, magazine, and book publishing.</p>
		<h3 id="c08-s06-s10" class="section1">Technology Pivot</h3>
		<p class="nonindent">Occasionally, a company discovers a way to achieve the same solution by using a completely different technology. Technology pivots are much more common in established businesses. In other words, they are a sustaining innovation, an incremental improvement designed to appeal to and retain an existing customer base. Established companies excel at this kind of pivot because so much is not changing. The customer segment is the same, the customer’s problem is the same, the value-capture model is the same, and the channel partners are the same. The only question is whether the new technology can provide superior price and/or performance compared with the existing technology.</p>
