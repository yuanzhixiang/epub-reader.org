<p class="p3">Let’s play a game. Are the following questions good or bad? Do they pass or fail The Mom Test? If they fail it, why? And how could we improve them? Work your way through the list and then read on for some discussion.</p>
<p class="p4"><br /></p>
<p class="p5">“Do you think it’s a good idea?”</p>
<p class="p5">“Would you buy a product which did X?”</p>
<p class="p5">“How much would you pay for X?”</p>
<p class="p5">“What would your dream product do?”</p>
<p class="p5">“Why do you bother?”</p>
<p class="p5">“What are the implications of that?”</p>
<p class="p5">“Talk me through the last time that happened.”</p>
<p class="p5">“Talk me through your workflow.”</p>
<p class="p5">“What else have you tried?”</p>
<p class="p5">“Would you pay X for a product which did Y?”</p>
<p class="p5">“How are you dealing with it now?”</p>
<p class="p5">“Where does the money come from?”</p>
<p class="p5">“Who else should I talk to?”</p>
<p class="p5">“Is there anything else I should have asked?”</p>
