      web-based retailer. This is perhaps the most common kind of online
      business, and it’s certainly the one that the majority of traditional
      analytics tools are aimed at. Big retailers like Amazon, Walmart.com,
      and Expedia are all e-commerce companies.</p><p>If the e-commerce model most closely matches your business, this
      chapter will show you some of the most important metrics you need to
      watch, as well as some “wrinkles” that make the analytics more
      complex.</p><p>Early e-commerce models consisted of a relatively simple “funnel”:
      a visitor arrived at the site, navigated through a series of pages to
      get to a particular item, clicked “buy,” provided some payment
      information, and completed a purchase. This is the traditional
      “conversion funnel” from which mainstream analytics packages like
      Omniture and Google Analytics emerged.</p><p>But modern e-commerce is seldom this simple:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The majority of buyers find what they’re looking for through
          search rather than by navigating across a series of pages. Shoppers
          start with an external search and then bounce back and forth from
          sites they visit to their search results, seeking the scent of what
          they’re after. Once they find it, on-site navigation becomes more
          important. This means on-site funnels are somewhat outdated;
          keywords are more important.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1030"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1042"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1340"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1353"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1526"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1721"/>Retailers use recommendation engines to anticipate
          what else a buyer might want, basing their suggestions on past
          buyers and other users with similar profiles. Few visitors see the
          same pages as one another.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Retailers are always optimizing performance, which means that
          they’re segmenting traffic. Mid- to large-size retailers segment
          their funnel by several tests that are being run to find the right
          products, offers, and prices.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Purchases begin far from the website itself, in social
          networks, email inboxes, and online communities, making the buying
          process harder to track.</p></li></ul></div><p>E-commerce companies make money in a straightforward way: they
      charge for products, which they then deliver either electronically
      (e.g., digital downloads on iTunes) or physically (e.g., shipping shoes
      from Zappos). They spend money to acquire customers through advertising
      and affiliate referrals. Prices are set based on what the market will
      bear, or on expectations set by competitors. Some large retailers with
      the budget and time to invest in it will generate prices algorithmically
      based on supply, demand, and constant testing, which in some cases leads
      to absurd pricing<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch08fn01" id="ch08fn01">25</a>]</sup> or recommendations based on factors such as browser
      type.</p><p>Loyalty-focused e-retailers like Amazon build a recurring
      relationship with their users. They have a wide variety of products to
      offer, and buyers return often, so they do everything they can to make
      purchasing simple and automatic (in Amazon’s case, the company patented
      the one-click purchase model, which it now licenses to other retailers,
      including Apple).</p><p>These relationship-focused e-commerce companies encourage users to
      build wishlists and review products, which means that while their core
      business model is e-commerce, they care about other models, such as
      user-generated content (UGC), too—as long as those models act as an
      enabler for purchases. On the other hand, e-commerce retailers that
      don’t expect frequent, repeat sales focus on getting as much from their
      buyer as they can and on getting the buyer to spread the word.</p><div class="sect1 pattern" title="What Mode of E-commerce Are You?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="pattern_what_mode_of_e-commerce_are_youq" style="clear: both">What Mode of E-commerce Are You?</h2></div></div></div><p>Kevin Hillstrom of Mine That Data, a consultancy focused on
        helping companies understand how their customers interact with
        advertising, <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1012"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1053"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1394"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1535"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1639"/>products, brands, and channels, works with a number of
        e-commerce companies. He says it’s essential for online retailers to
        know what kind of relationship they have with their buyers, because
        this drives everything from marketing strategy to shopping cart size.
        To understand this, he calculates the <span class="emphasis"><em>annual repurchase
        rate</em></span>: what percentage of people who bought something from
        you last year will do so this year?</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Acquisition mode</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>If less than 40% of last year’s buyers will buy this year,
              then the focus of the business is on new customer acquisition.
              Loyalty programs aren’t good long-term investments for this kind
              of business. Kevin says that 70% of e-commerce businesses fall
              into this category when they’re mature. Vendors of scuba or rock
              climbing equipment might be a great example of this: many of
              their customers buy gear once, and don’t get so hooked on the
              hobby that they need to upgrade. That’s not a bad thing—it just
              dictates marketing strategy. An online vendor of eyewear might
              put more of its marketing efforts into convincing past buyers to
              refer others, and less into convincing those buyers to purchase
              multiple pairs of glasses, for example.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Hybrid mode</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>If 40–60% of last year’s buyers will buy this year, then
              the company will grow with a mix of new customers and returning
              customers. It needs to focus on acquisition as well as on
              increasing purchase frequency—the average customer will buy 2 to
              2.5 times a year. Zappos is a hybrid model e-commerce
              company.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Loyalty mode</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>If 60% or more of last year’s buyers will buy something
              this year, the company needs to focus on loyalty, encouraging
              loyal clients to buy more frequently. Loyalty programs work well
              only if the retailer has this kind of engagement, and only 10%
              of e-commerce businesses end up in this mode when mature. Amazon
              is a good example of a company in this mode.</p></dd></dl></div><p>The annual repurchase rate is an early indicator of how an
        e-commerce startup will succeed in the long term. Even before a year
        has elapsed, an e-commerce company can look at 90-day repurchase rates
        and get a sense of which model it’s in.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>A 90-day repurchase rate of 1% to 15% means you’re in
            acquisition mode.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1447"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1634"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1742"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1883"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2353"/>A 90-day repurchase rate of 15% to 30% means you’re
            in hybrid mode.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A 90-day repurchase rate of over 30% means you’re in loyalty
            mode.</p></li></ul></div><p>There’s nothing particularly bad about any of these models.
        Kevin has clients where only 25% of this year’s buyers will purchase
        something next year. These clients are successful because they know
        they need a large number of new customers at relatively low costs, and
        they concentrate all of their marketing efforts around reliable,
        affordable customer acquisition.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter whatsoever what mode a business is in. But it
        means <span class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span> for the CEO to know what mode he
        or she is in,” Kevin says. “I see too many leaders trying to increase
        loyalty. If you’re in acquisition mode, you probably can’t—and
        shouldn’t try to—increase loyalty. The average customer only needs a
        couple of pairs of jeans a year, for instance. You can’t force the
        customer to buy more! Knowing your customer and mode is really
        important.”</p><p>Kevin says he frequently sees business leaders with seasonal
        e-commerce properties trying to convince customers to buy gifts
        off-season. “It doesn’t work,” he says. “They’re in acquisition mode.
        They’re better off creating awareness during the year so that they get
        new customers in November and December.”</p><p>While it’s important to optimize revenues, don’t try to make
        your customers into something they’re not. “I don’t try to force my
        customer to do things my customer isn’t pre-inclined to do. With
        Zappos, for example, I wouldn’t necessarily try to push my customer
        from hybrid mode to loyalty mode. But I do try to improve customer
        service (free returns), and that brings in new customers (half of
        hybrid mode success) who feel comfortable with my business,” says
        Kevin. “If I am in acquisition mode, then I will still try to improve
        service and merchandise and the like, but I know that my primary goal
        is to always get new customers, even once my business is
        mature.”</p><p>Kevin says it’s difficult to move the annual repurchase rate by
        more than 10%, despite a company’s best efforts. “If the annual
        repurchase rate is 30%, it will vary between 27% and 33%,” he
        says.</p><p>With the rise of social networks and sites like Facebook and
        Pinterest, which can refer visitors, e-commerce companies are
        increasingly interested in a long funnel that begins with a tweet, a
        video, or a link, and ends with a purchase. Online retailers need to
        understand what messages, on what <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1338"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1490"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1688"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1906"/>platforms, generate the kinds of visitors who buy
        things. Once they’re on the site, the emphasis is on maximizing the
        amount of stuff a buyer will purchase.</p><p>Getting pricing right is critical—particularly if you’re an
        acquisition-mode e-commerce site that gets only one chance to extract
        revenue from a customer. A 1992 study on business optimization by
        management consulting firm McKinsey compared the impact of improving
        different aspects of the business on operating profit.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch08fn02" id="ch08fn02">26</a>]</sup></p><p>As <a class="xref" href="ch08.html#want_to_fix_your_businessquestion_mark_g" title="Figure 8-1. Want to fix your business?

        illustrates, getting pricing right has a huge impact on the overall
        profitability of a business. A later study conducted in 2003 suggested
        a smaller impact of only 8%—but one that still far outstripped other
        efforts.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch08fn03" id="ch08fn03">27</a>]</sup></p><div class="figure"><a id="want_to_fix_your_businessquestion_mark_g"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00015"/><img alt="Want to fix your business?

        the number of reviews written or the number considered helpful, but
        this is really a secondary business within the organization, and we’ll
        deal with these when we look at the user-generated content model in
        <a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Model Five: User-Generated Content">Chapter 12</a>. For now, let’s
        look at the preceding metrics in a bit more detail.</p><div class="sect2" title="Conversion Rate"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="conversion_rate">Conversion Rate</h3></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1298"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2105"/>Conversion rate is simply the percentage of visitors
          to your site who buy something. It’s one of the first metrics you
          use to assess how you’re doing. It’s simple to calculate and
          experiment with. You’ll slice conversion rate in many ways—by
          demographics, by copy, by referral, and so on—to see what makes
          people more likely to buy.</p><p>Early on, conversion rate may even be more important than
          total revenue because your initial goal is to simply prove that
          someone will buy something (and it gives you that person’s email
          address and data on what he purchases). But there’s also a risk in
          focusing too intensely on conversion rate. Conversion rate is highly
          dependent on your type of e-commerce business, and whether your
          success will be driven by loyalty, new customer acquisition, or a
          hybrid of the two.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Purchases Per Year"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="purchases_per_year">Purchases Per Year</h3></div></div></div><p>While conversion rate is important, it doesn’t tell the whole
          story. There are many examples of e-commerce sites with high or low
          conversion rates that are successful. It depends on the type of
          e-commerce site and how people buy. A store that sells coffins
          probably sells only one per lifetime; a grocery store sells to a
          customer several times a week.</p><p>If you look at the repurchase rate on a 90-day cycle, it
          becomes a very good leading indicator for what type of e-commerce
          site you have. There’s no right or wrong answer, but it is important
          to know whether to focus more on loyalty or more on
          acquisition.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Shopping Cart Size"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="shopping_cart_size">Shopping Cart Size</h3></div></div></div><p>The other half of the conversion rate equation is the size of
          the shopping cart. Not only do you want to know what percentage of
          people bought something, you also want to know how much they spent.
          You may find that one campaign is more likely to make people buy,
          but another might make fewer people spend more money.</p><p>In practice, you’ll compare the total revenue you’re
          generating to the way in which you acquired that revenue, in order
          to identify the most lucrative segments of your reachable audience.
          But don’t get too caught up in top-line revenue; profit is what
          really matters.</p><p>Bill D’Alessandro of Skyway Ventures, a private investment
          firm focused on e-commerce companies, says, “The key to successful
          e-commerce is in increasing shopping cart size; that’s really where
          the money is made. I like to think of customer acquisition cost as a
          fixed cost, so any increase in order size is expanding your
          margin.”</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Abandonment"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="abandonment">Abandonment</h3></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1003"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1143"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1204"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1223"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1494"/>Not everyone buys something. At its simplest,
          abandonment rate is the opposite of conversion rate. But a
          purchasing process often has several steps—reviewing items in a
          shopping cart, providing shipping information, entering billing
          details, and so on. In some cases, the process may even involve a
          third-party site: Kickstarter sends users to Amazon to provide their
          credit card information, and Eventbrite links to PayPal so buyers
          can pay for tickets.</p><p>The number of people who abandon a funnel at each of these
          stages is the abandonment rate. It’s important to analyze it for
          each step in order to see which parts of the process are hurting you
          the most. In some cases, this may be a particular form field—for
          example, asking people for their nationality could be alienating
          buyers. Tools like ClickTale perform abandonment analysis within the
          form itself, making it easier to pinpoint bottlenecks in the
          conversion process where you’re losing customers.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Cost of Customer Acquisition"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="cost_of_customer_acquisition">Cost of Customer Acquisition</h3></div></div></div><p>Once you know you can extract money from visitors, you’ll want
          to drive traffic to the site. You may be using advertising, social
          media outreach, mailing lists, or affiliates. Whatever the case,
          you’re going to need to add it up. E-commerce sites are simple math:
          make more from selling things than it costs you to find buyers and
          deliver the goods.</p><p>Accounting for the cost of acquisition in aggregate is fairly
          easy; it’s more complicated when you have myriad channels driving
          traffic to your site. The good news is that analytics tools were
          literally built to do this for you. The reason Google has a free
          analytics product is because the company makes money from relevant
          advertising, and wants to make it as easy as possible for you to buy
          ads and measure their effectiveness.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Revenue Per Customer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="revenue_per_customer">Revenue Per Customer</h3></div></div></div><p>Revenue per customer (or lifetime value) is important for all
          types of e-commerce businesses, regardless of whether you’re focused
          on new customer acquisition or loyalty (or both). Even if your
          business doesn’t engender loyalty (because you’re selling something
          that’s infrequently purchased), you want to maximize revenue per
          customer; you do so by increasing shopping cart size and conversion
          while reducing abandonment. Revenue per customer is really an
          aggregate metric of other key numbers, and represents a good, single
          measure of your e-commerce business’s health.</p></div></div><div class="sect1 case_study" title="WineExpress Increases Revenue by 41% Per Visitor"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_wineexpress_increases_revenue" style="clear: both">WineExpress Increases Revenue by 41% Per Visitor</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1006"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1233"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1349"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1504"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2319"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2329"/>WineExpress.com is the exclusive wine shop partner of

        wine-tasting video with the company’s highly regarded wine
        director.</p><p>The “Wine of the Day” page already converted well, but
        WineExpress.com felt there was an opportunity to improve it. However,
        the team was well aware of the challenge which is faced by all
        e-commerce sites: striking a balance between optimizing sales
        transactions and optimizing overall revenues. Focusing too much on
        sales conversions may negatively impact the bottom line if the average
        order size drops in the process.</p><p>WineExpress.com engaged conversion optimization agency
        WiderFunnel Marketing to develop and execute a strategy for the “Wine
        of the Day” page. WiderFunnel developed and tested three design
        variations, aiming mostly at testing different layout approaches.

        original layout.</p><p>In the end, one of the variations was a clear winner, leading to
        a 41% increase in revenue per visitor. “Conversion also went up,” says
        Chris Goward, CEO of WiderFunnel, “but the key here is that revenue
        per visitor went up substantially. A lot of e-commerce vendors focus
        too much on conversion. For WineExpress.com the success is that people
        bought substantially more product.”</p><div class="figure"><a id="original_wineexpress_quotation_markwine"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00016"/><img alt="The original WineExpress “Wine of the Day” page" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989274.png.jpg"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 8-2. The original WineExpress “Wine of the Day” page</div></div><p>The winning layout and design is shown in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html#how_would_41percent_more_revenue_per_vis" title="Figure 8-3. How would 41% more revenue per visitor change your business?">Figure 8-3</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="how_would_41percent_more_revenue_per_vis"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00017"/><img alt="How would 41% more revenue per visitor change your business?" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989275.png.jpg"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 8-3. How would 41% more revenue per visitor change your

        the right metric. You don’t just want a high conversion rate—though
        that’s good. You want high <span class="emphasis"><em>revenue per visitor</em></span>,
        or <span class="emphasis"><em>high customer lifetime value</em></span> (CLV), because
        that’s what’s really driving your business model.</p><div class="sect2" title="Keywords and Search Terms"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="keywords_and_search_terms">Keywords and Search Terms</h3></div></div></div><p>Most people find products by searching for them, whether
          that’s in a web browser, on a search engine, or within a site. In
          each case, you want to know which keywords drive traffic that turns
          into money.</p><p>For paid search, you’re going to be bidding against others for
          popular keywords in search engines like Google. Understanding which
          words are a comparatively good “value”—not too expensive, but still
          able to drive a reasonable amount of traffic—is what search engine
          marketing professionals do for a living.</p><p>For unpaid search, you’ll be more focused on good, compelling
          content that improves your ranking with search engines, and on
          writing copy that includes the desirable search terms your paying
          customers tend to use (so you’ll be featured in search results
          because of your relevance).</p><p>You also want to analyze search <span class="emphasis"><em>within</em></span>
          your site. First, you want to be sure you have what people are
          after. If users are searching for something and not finding it—or
          searching, then pressing the back button—that’s a sign that you
          don’t have what they want. Second, if a significant chunk of
          searches fall into a particular category, that’s a sign that you
          might want to alter your positioning, or add that category to the
          home page, to see if you can capture more of that market faster.
          Jason Billingsley, former VP of Innovation at Elastic Path, an
          enterprise e-commerce platform vendor, says, “Numbers vary by
          vertical and by site, but on-site search tools typically account for
          5–15% of navigation.”</p><p>We’re not going to get into the details of search engine
          optimization and search engine marketing here—those are worlds unto
          themselves. For now, realize that search is a significant part of

          additional items to visitors. Today, these engines are becoming more
          widespread thanks to third-party recommendation services that work
          with smaller retailers. Even bloggers have this kind of algorithm,
          suggesting other articles similar to the one the visitor is
          currently reading.</p><p>There are many different approaches to recommendations. Some
          use what the buyer has purchased in the past; others try to predict
          purchases from visitor attributes like geography, referral, or what
          the visitor has clicked so far. Predictive analysis of visitors
          relies heavily on machine learning, and the metrics you’ll track
          will vary from tool to tool, but they all boil down to one thing:
          <span class="emphasis"><em>how much additional revenue am I generating through
          recommendations?</em></span></p><p>When you make adjustments to the recommendation engine, you’ll
          want to see if you moved the needle in the right direction.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Virality"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="virality">Virality</h3></div></div></div><p>For many e-commerce sites, virality is important, because
          referral and viral attention drives cheap, high-value traffic. It
          has the lowest cost of customer acquisition and the highest implied
          recommendation from someone the recipient trusts.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Mailing List Click-Through Rates"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="mailing_list_click-through_rates">Mailing List Click-Through Rates</h3></div></div></div><p>Email might not seem particularly sexy in a mobile, always-on
          world. But consider this: if you have the permission to reach out to
          your customers—and they do what you tell them to—you can keep them
          engaged far more effectively. Fred Wilson, partner at venture
          capital firm Union Square Ventures, calls email a secret
          weapon.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch08fn04" id="ch08fn04">28</a>]</sup></p><p>Just a few years ago, many analysts and investors were
          wondering whether social media was going to lead to the end of
          email. In an ironic twist of fate, it turns out that social media
          adoption is driven by email. More and more social applications are
          leveraging the power of email to drive repeat usage and
          retention.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1155"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1156"/>Every email you send can be blocked in many ways
          before a user does something you want, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html#every_email_runs_this_gauntletsemicolon" title="Figure 8-4. Every email runs this gauntlet; is it any wonder your click-throughs are low?">Figure 8-4</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="every_email_runs_this_gauntletsemicolon"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00018"/><img alt="Every email runs this gauntlet; is it any wonder your click-throughs are low?" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989276.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 8-4. Every email runs this gauntlet; is it any wonder your
            click-throughs are low?</div></div><p>Even those who respond to the call to action within a message
          might not do something useful once they get to your website. In some
          cases, the unsubscribe rate caused by a bad email can overshadow any
          profit from the campaign, so email is a tool to use
          carefully.</p><p>You calculate the email click-through rate by dividing the
          number of visits you get from a campaign by the number of messages
          you’ve sent. A more sophisticated analysis of email click-through
          rate will include a breakdown of the various places where things can
          go wrong—for example, what percentage of email addresses didn’t work
          anymore—and a look at the eventual outcome you’re after (such as a
          purchase).</p><p>You also need to create a campaign contribution
          metric—basically, the added revenue from the campaign, minus the
          cost of the campaign and the loss due to unsubscribes. The good news
          is that most email platforms include this data with minimal
          effort.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Offline and Online Combinations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="offline_and_online_combinations" style="clear: both">Offline and Online Combinations</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1104"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1343"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1344"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1346"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1348"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2088"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2089"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2164"/>All e-commerce vendors have to deliver something to
        buyers. That delivery may be electronic, but in most cases, it means
        moving physical goods around. Not only do high shipping costs reduce
        conversion rates, but successful, timely delivery is also a huge
        factor in buyer satisfaction and repeat purchases. Offline components
        of any e-commerce business need to be analyzed carefully.</p><div class="sect2" title="Shipping Time"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="shipping_time">Shipping Time</h3></div></div></div><p>Real-time delivery and next-day shipping are increasingly
          common, and buyers are becoming more demanding. Shipping time is
          key, and it’s tightly linked to how effectively the retailer handles
          logistics. E-commerce companies can most likely achieve significant
          operational efficiencies just by optimizing their fulfillment and
          shipping processes. These efficiencies turn into a competitive
          advantage, because they let you sell to consumers who are more
          interested in faster, better-quality service than the cheapest
          price.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Stock Availability"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="stock_availability">Stock Availability</h3></div></div></div><p>“When items are out of stock, sales go down,” says Jason
          Billingsley. “Of course that’s obvious, but few e-commerce vendors
          do anything about it.” Improving your inventory management can make
          a big difference to your bottom line. Jason recommends lowering
          out-of-stock items on product list or category pages, effectively
          hiding them from consumers. You can also hide these items from
          searches, or again, make sure they appear lower in the search
          results.</p><p>It’s also interesting to analyze inventory versus sales. “A
          lot of e-commerce vendors hold too much inventory for things that
          don’t sell well, and not enough for things that do sell well,” says
          Jason. He recommends aligning product categories based on how much
          they make up of sales versus inventory. If you’re not selling a lot
          in a product category, but that group of products makes up a high
          percentage of your inventory, things are out of balance.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Visualizing the E-commerce Business"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="visualizing_the_e-commerce_business" style="clear: both">Visualizing the E-commerce Business</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="xref" href="ch08.html#more_than_a_typical_funnel_how_e-commerc" title="Figure 8-5. More than a typical funnel: how e-commerce businesses acquire customers">Figure 8-5</a>

        model involving a one-time purchase. Plenty of services, however, are
        subscription-based. This complicates things.</p><p>Subscription services bill the customer on a regular basis.
        Churn is easier to measure—the customer doesn’t renew his account or
        cancels outright—but happens more dramatically. Rather than a gradual
        reduction in purchases over time, the customer’s revenue simply stops.
        If this is you, check out the following business model—Software as a
        Service—because it applies to you as well.</p><p>Phone companies devote considerable effort to tackling this kind
        of churn. They build sophisticated models that predict when a
        subscriber is about to cancel her service, and then offer her a new
        phone or a discount on a renewed contract just before the cancellation
        happens.</p><p>Expired payment information is also a concern for subscriptions.
        If you try to charge a customer’s credit card for his monthly renewal
        and the transaction fails, you have to convince him to re-enter
        payment details.</p><p>From an analytics perspective, this means tracking additional
        metrics for the rate of payment expiration, the effectiveness of
        renewal campaigns, and the factors that help (or hinder) renewal
        rates. These metrics matter later on as you’re working to reduce
        churn, but as the total number of loyal users grows, renewal revenue
        represents a significant portion of total revenue.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Key Takeaways"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="key_takeaways" style="clear: both">Key Takeaways</h2></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>It’s vital to know if you’re focused on loyalty or
