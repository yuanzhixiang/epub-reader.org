      <span class="emphasis"><em>Lean Analytics</em></span> is “what’s normal?” It’s something
      we get asked all the time: “How do I know what’s a normal or ideal value
      for the metrics I’m tracking? How do I know if it’s going well or not?
      Should I keep optimizing this metric, or move on to something
      else?”</p><p>At the outset, many people cautioned us against trying to find a
      typical value for a particular metric. After all, startups are, by
      definition, trying to break the rules, which means the rules are being
      rewritten all the time. But we think it’s important to try to define
      “normal” for two big reasons.</p><p>First, you need to know if you’re in the ballpark. If your current
      behavior is outrageously far from that of everyone else, you should be
      aware of it. If, on the other hand, you’re already as good as you’re
      going to get—move on. You’ve already optimized a key metric, and you’ll
      get diminishing returns trying to improve it further.</p><p>Second, you need to know what sport you’re playing. Online metrics
      are in flux, which makes it hard to find a realistic baseline. Only a
      few years ago, for example, typical e-commerce conversion rates were in
      the 1–3% range. The best-in-class online retailers got a 7–15%
      conversion rate, because they had offline mindshare or had worked hard
      to become the “default” tool for purchase. These numbers have changed in
      recent years, though, because people now consider the Web the “default”
      storefront for many purchases. Today, pizza delivery companies have
      <span class="emphasis"><em>extremely</em></span> high conversion rates because, well,
      that’s how you buy pizza.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1074"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1097"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1161"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1234"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1806"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2335"/>In other words: there is a normal or ideal for most
      metrics, and that normal will change significantly as a particular
      business model goes from being novel to being mainstream.</p><div class="sect1 case_study" title="WP Engine Discovers the 2% Cancellation Rate"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_wp_engine_discovers_the_2perc" style="clear: both">WP Engine Discovers the 2% Cancellation Rate</h2></div></div></div><p>WP Engine is a fast-growing hosting company specializing
        exclusively in hosting WordPress sites.<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.ch21fn01" id="ch21fn01">76</a>]</sup> Successful entrepreneur and popular blogger Jason Cohen
        founded the company in July 2010. In November 2011, WP Engine raised
        $1.2M in financing to accelerate growth and handle the ongoing
        challenges of scaling the business.</p><p>WP Engine is a service company. Its customers rely on WP Engine
        to provide fast, quality hosting with constant uptime. WP Engine is
        doing a great job, but customers still cancel. All companies have
        cancellations (or churn), and it’s one of the most critical metrics to
        track and understand—not only is it essential for calculating metrics
        like customer lifetime value, but it’s also an early warning signal
        that something is going wrong or that a competing solution has
        emerged.</p><p>Having a cancellation number isn’t enough; you need to
        understand <span class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span> people are abandoning your product
        or service. Jason did just that by calling customers who cancelled.
        “Not everyone wanted to speak with me; some people never responded to
        my calls,” he recalls. “But enough people were willing to talk, even
        after they had left WP Engine, that I learned a lot about why they
        were leaving.” According to Jason, most people leave WP Engine because
        of factors outside of the company’s control (such as the project
        ending where hosting was needed), but Jason wanted to dig
        further.</p><p>Having a metric and an understanding of the reasons people were
        leaving wasn’t enough. Jason went out and found a benchmark for
        cancellation rate. This is one of the most challenging things for a
        startup to do: find a relevant number (or line in the sand) against
        which to compare yourself. Jason researched the hosting space using
        his investors and advisors. One of WP Engine’s investors is
        Automattic, the company behind WordPress, which also has a sizeable
        hosting business.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1592"/>Jason found that for established hosting companies,
        there’s a “best case scenario” benchmark for cancellation rate per
        month, which is 2%. That means every month—for even the best and
        biggest hosting companies around—you can expect 2% of your customers
        to leave.</p><p>On the surface, that looks like a huge number. “When I first saw
        our churn, which was around 2%, I was very concerned,” Jason says.
        “But when I found out that 2% is pretty much the lowest churn you’ll
        get in the hosting business, it changed my perspective a great deal.”
        Had Jason not known that this is simply a fact of life in the hosting
        industry, WP Engine might have invested time and money trying to move
        a metric that wouldn’t budge—money that would have been far better
        spent elsewhere.</p><p>Instead, with a benchmark in hand, Jason was able to focus on
        other issues and key performance indicators (KPIs), all the while
        keeping his eye on any fluctuation in cancellation rate. He doesn’t
        rule out the possibility of trying to break through the 2%
        cancellation rate at some point (after all, there can be significant
        value in reducing that churn), but he’s able to prioritize according
        to what’s going on in his business today, and where the biggest
        trouble spots lie, all while keeping an eye on the future success of
        the company.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>WP Engine built a healthy WordPress hosting business, but

        Learned</strong></span></p><p>It’s easy to get stuck on one specific metric that looks bad and
        invest considerable time and money trying to improve it. Until you
        know where you stand against competitors and industry averages, you’re
        blind. Having benchmarks helps you decide whether to keep working on a
        specific metric or move on to the next challenge.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Average Isn’t Good Enough"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="average_isnapostrophet_good_enough" style="clear: both">Average Isn’t Good Enough</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1522"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1795"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2135"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2136"/>The Startup Genome project has collected key metrics
        from thousands of startups through its Startup Compass site.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch21fn02" id="ch21fn02">77</a>]</sup> Co-founder Bjoern Lasse Herrmann shared some of the
        metrics he’s gathered about an “average” startup. They serve as a
        sobering reminder that being average simply isn’t good enough. There’s
        a line in the sand, a point where you know you’re ready to move to the
        next KPI—and most companies aren’t anywhere near it.</p><p>Consider this: if you get your churn rate below 5%—ideally as
        low as 2%—each month, you have a reasonably sticky product. Bjoern’s
        average is between 12% (for indirectly monetized sites) and 19% (for
        those that monetize directly from users)—nowhere near good enough to
        move to the next stage.</p><p>Furthermore, consumer applications have a nearly 1:1 CAC to CLV
        ratio. That means they’re spending all the money they make acquiring
        new users. As we’ve seen, you’re doing well when you spend less than a
        third of your customer revenue acquiring new customers. For
        bigger-ticket applications (with a CLV of over $50K) things are less
        bleak, with most companies spending between 0.2% and 2% of CLV on
        acquisition.</p><p>Startup Compass has some great comparative insight, and we
        encourage you to use it to measure yourself against other companies.
        But realize that there’s a reason most startups fail:
        <span class="emphasis"><em>average is nowhere near good enough</em></span>.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="What Is Good Enough?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="what_is_good_enoughquestion_mark" style="clear: both">What Is Good Enough?</h2></div></div></div><p>There are a few metrics—like growth rate, visitor engagement,
        pricing targets, customer acquisition, virality, mailing list
        effectiveness, uptime, and time on site—that apply to most (if not
        all) business models. We’ll look at these next. Then, in the following
        chapters, we’ll dig into metrics specific to the six business models
        we’ve covered earlier. Remember, though, that while you might turn
        immediately to the chapter for your business model, there’s always
        some overlap and relevant metrics in other business models that should
        be helpful to you. So we encourage you to look at what’s normal for
        other business models, too.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Growth Rate"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="growth_rate" style="clear: both">Growth Rate</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1507"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1509"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1797"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2339"/>Investor Paul Graham makes a good case<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch21fn03" id="ch21fn03">78</a>]</sup> that above all else, a startup is a company designed to
        grow fast. In fact, it’s this growth that distinguishes a startup from
        other new ventures like a cobbler or a restaurant. Startups, Paul
        says, go through three distinct growth phases: slow, where the
        organization is searching for a product and market to tackle; fast,
        where it has figured out how to make and sell it at scale; and slow
        again, as it becomes a big company and encounters internal constraints
        or market saturation, and tries to overcome Porter’s “hole in the
        middle.”</p><p>At Paul’s startup accelerator, Y Combinator, teams track growth
        rate weekly because of the short timeframe. “A good growth rate during
        YC is 5–7% a week,” he says. “If you can hit 10% a week you’re doing
        exceptionally well. If you can only manage 1%, it’s a sign you haven’t
        yet figured out what you’re doing.” If the company is at the Revenue
        stage, then growth is measured in revenue; if it’s not charging money
        yet, growth is measured in active users.</p><div class="sect2" title="Is Growth at All Costs a Good Thing?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="is_growth_at_all_costs_a_good_thingquest">Is Growth at All Costs a Good Thing?</h3></div></div></div><p>There’s no question that growth is important. But focusing on
          growth too soon is bad. We’ve seen how inherent virality—that’s
          built into your product’s use—is better than artificial virality
          you’ve added as an afterthought. A flood of new visitors might grow
          your user base, but might also be detrimental to your business.
          Similarly, while some kinds of growth are good, other kinds aren’t
          sustainable. Premature scaling, such as firing up the paid engine
          before you’re sticky, can exacerbate issues with product quality,
          cash flow, and user satisfaction. It kills you just as you’re
          getting started.</p><p>Sean Ellis notes that growth hackers are constantly testing
          and tweaking new ways of achieving growth, but that “during this
          process it is easy to lose sight of the big picture. When this
          happens, growth eventually falls off a cliff.”<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch21fn04" id="ch21fn04">79</a>]</sup></p><p>He goes on to say, “Sustainable growth programs are built on a
          core understanding of the value of your solution in the minds of
          your most passionate customers.” As we saw in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Analytics Frameworks">Chapter 5</a>, Sean’s Startup Growth Pyramid
          illustrates that scaling your business comes only after you’ve found
          <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1094"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1111"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1753"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1799"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1813"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2016"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2247"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2327"/>product/market fit and your unfair advantage. In other
          words: stickiness comes before virality, and virality comes before
          scale.</p><p>Most Y Combinator startups (and most startups, for that
          matter) focus on growth before they hit product/market fit. In some
          cases this is a necessity, particularly if the value of the startup
          depends on a network effect—after all, Skype’s no good if nobody
          else is using it. But while rapid growth can accelerate the
          discovery of product/market fit, it can just as easily destroy the
          startup if the timing isn’t right.</p><p>Paul’s growth strategy is also a very B2C-biased way to look
          at the world. B2B organizations have a different flow, from a few
          early customers for whom they look like consultants, to later-stage
          customers who tolerate a more generic, standardized product or
          service. Growing a B2B organization prematurely can alienate your
          core of loyal customers who are helping to build your business,
          stalling revenue and eliminating the referrals, case studies, and
          testimonials needed to grow your sales.</p><p>This is a universal problem, best described by the
          <span class="emphasis"><em>technology lifecycle adoption</em></span> model, first
          proposed by George Beal, Everett Rogers, and Joe Bohlen,<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch21fn05" id="ch21fn05">80</a>]</sup> and expanded by Geoffrey Moore:<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch21fn06" id="ch21fn06">81</a>]</sup> it takes a lot of work to move from early adopters to
          laggards as the product becomes more mainstream and the barriers to
          adoption fall.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Bottom Line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="bottom_line">Bottom Line</h3></div></div></div><p>As you’re validating your problem and solution, ask yourself
          whether there are enough people who really care enough to sustain a
          5% growth rate—but don’t strive for that rate of growth at the
          expense of really understanding your customers and building a
          meaningful solution. When you’re a pre-revenue startup at or near
          product/market fit, your line in the sand should be 5% growth for
          active users each week, and once you’re generating revenues, they
          should grow at 5% a week.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Number of Engaged Visitors"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="number_of_engaged_visitors" style="clear: both">Number of Engaged Visitors</h2></div></div></div><p>Fred Wilson says that across Union Square Ventures’ portfolio
        companies, there’s a consistent ratio for engagement and concurrent
        users.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch21fn07" id="ch21fn07">82</a>]</sup> He says that for a web service or mobile

        is consistent across a wide variety of applications, from social to
        music to games. Getting to this stage of regular use and engagement is
        a sign that you’re ready to start growing, and to move into the
        Virality, Revenue, and Scale stages of your business.</p><div class="sect2" title="Bottom Line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="bottom_line-id00007">Bottom Line</h3></div></div></div><p>Aim for 30% of your registered users to visit once a month,

        different things, so there’s no easy way to compare pricing across
        companies. But you can learn some lessons from different pricing
        approaches.</p><p>A fundamental element of any pricing strategy is elasticity:
        when you charge more, you sell less; when you charge less, you sell
        more. Back in 1890, Alfred Marshall defined the <span class="emphasis"><em>price
        elasticity of demand</em></span> as follows:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The elasticity (or responsiveness) of demand in a market is
          great or small according as the amount demanded increases much or
          little for a given fall in price, and diminishes much or little for
          a given rise in price.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch21fn08" id="ch21fn08">83</a>]</sup></p></blockquote></div><p>Unlike Marshall, you have the world’s greatest pricing

        Sharon, and sold to Group Commerce in 2011. The idea came from work
        Dan was doing in 2004 with a team at NYU focused on how digital media
        was changing how people communicated.</p><p>This was in the early days of social networking: Friendster was
        the dominant social platform. Socialight’s first incarnation was as a
        destination social network for Java-enabled mobile phones, which were
        considered the pinnacle of mobile app technology at the time. People
        could place “sticky notes” around the world, and then collaborate,
        organize, and share them with friends or the community as a
        whole.</p><p>Back then, Dan wasn’t focused on pricing, but shortly after
        launching Socialight, the founders realized that power users were
        looking for different feature sets based on how they were using the
        product. “The mobile software market was starting to mature, along
        with location-based services and devices like iPhones,” said Dan. “We
        also started getting approached by companies that wanted to pay for us
        to build and host mobile and social apps for them.”</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1480"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1889"/>This started the company’s pivot from B2C to B2B. It
        built an API to let others build their own applications, and then
        built a more advanced mobile app-maker product. This achieved good
        traction, with over 1,000 communities built atop it.</p><p>As Socialight moved into the B2B space, it launched a
        three-tiered freemium business model. The two paying tiers were called
        Premium and Pro, and cost $250 and $1,000–$5,500 per month,
        respectively. The main difference between the Premium and Pro
        offerings was the amount of involvement Socialight had with those
        customers—at $1,000–$5,500 per month, Socialight was very involved
        with lots of hours invested per month to work with customers.</p><p>Four months into its freemium launch, the company realized there
        was a problem. While the Pro customers were great for top-line
        revenue, they were costing Socialight a <span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of
        money. “We realized that the margins we were getting from Pro
        customers were nowhere near as good as those from Premium, even though
        the revenue from Pro customers was great. Moreover, Pro customers took
        a lot longer to close, which is not something we understood well
        enough early on,” says Dan.</p><p>This is where a greater understanding and sophistication around
        price-related metrics becomes so important. Tracking revenue by
        pricing tier, which Socialight did from the outset, is a good place to
        start. But the other fundamental business metrics are perhaps even
        more important. For example, Socialight could have focused on customer
        acquisition cost versus customer lifetime value to identify its
        revenue and cost problems. Or it could have focused on margins earlier
        in the process, which would have helped identify its revenue issues.
        Eventually, the company increased the Pro tier to $5,500/month
        exclusively, a reflection of the increased support required by
        customers.</p><p>Socialight never got around to experimenting with different
        pricing strategies (it was acquired, after all!), but Dan would have
        liked to. “I think we could have reduced the Pro feature set a small
        amount and reduced its pricing significantly,” he says.</p><p>This underscores the tricky balance in a freemium or tiered
        pricing model: how do you make sure that the features/services being
        offered fit into the right packages at the right price? Instead of
        looking at pricing, Dan was able to experiment with other metrics. He
        looked for ways to encourage customers using the free service to
        convert to the Premium tier (and focused a lot less on the Pro tier).
        The focus on conversion (from free to paid) helped Socialight grow its
        business and get the bulk of its paid users into the profitable
        tier.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1158"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1355"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1900"/><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Socialight switched from a consumer to business market,

        Learned</strong></span></p><p>Consider the impact that pricing has on customer behavior, both
        in terms of attracting and discouraging them. Price is an important
        tool for getting your customers to do what you want, and it should
        always be compared not only to cost of sales, but also to cost of
        goods sold and marginal cost.</p><p>Research on price elasticity suggests that it applies most in
        young, growing markets. Think about getting a walk-in haircut, for
        example. You may not check how much the haircut is; you know it’ll be
        within a certain price range. If the stylist presented you with a bill
        for $500, you’d be outraged. There’s a well-defined expectation of
        pricing. While startups often live in young, growing markets where
        prices are less established, bigger, more stable markets are often
        subject to commodity pricing, regulation, bulk discounts, long-term
        contracts, and other externalities that complicate the simplicity of
        the elasticity just described.</p><p>Your business model will affect the role pricing plays for you.
        If you’re a media site, someone is already optimizing revenue for you
        in the form of ad auctions. If you’re a two-sided marketplace, you may
        need to help your sellers price their offerings correctly in order to
        maximize your own profits. And if you’re a UGC site, you may not care
        about pricing—or may want to apply similar approaches to determine the
        most effective rewards or incentives for your users.</p><p>In a study of 133 companies, Patrick Campbell found that most
        respondents compared themselves to the competition when setting

        customer, we can define it as a percentage of your customers’ lifetime
        value. This is the total revenue a customer brings to you in the life
        of her relationship with you. This varies by business model, so we’ll
        tackle it in subsequent, model-specific chapters, but a good rule of
        thumb is that your acquisition cost should be less than a third of the
        total value a customer brings you over her lifetime. This isn’t a
        hard-and-fast rule, but it’s widely cited. Here’s some of the
        reasoning behind it.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The CLV you’ve calculated is probably wrong. There’s
            uncertainty in any business model. You’re guessing how much you’ll
            make from a customer in her lifetime. If you’re off, you may have
            spent too much to acquire her, and it’ll take a long time to find
            out whether you’ve underestimated churn or overestimated customer
            spend. “In my experience, churn has the biggest impact on CLV, and
            unfortunately, churn is a lagging indicator,” says Zach Nies. He
            suggests offering only <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1804"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2281"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2287"/>month-to-month subscription plans initially in order
            to get a better picture of true churn early on.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The acquisition cost is probably wrong, too. You’re paying
            the costs of acquiring customers up front. New customers incur
            up-front cost—onboarding, adding more infrastructure, etc.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Between the time that you spend money to acquire someone and
            the time you recoup that investment, you’re basically “lending”
            the customer money. The longer it takes you to recoup the money,
            the more you’ll need. And because money comes from either a bank
            loan or an equity investor, you’ll either wind up paying interest,
            or diluting yourself by taking on investors. This is a complex
            balance to strike. Bad cash-flow management kills startups.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Limiting yourself to a customer acquisition cost (CAC) of
            only a third of your CLV will force you to verify your acquisition
            costs sooner, which will make you more honest—so you’ll recognize
            a mistake before it’s too late. If your product or service costs a
            lot to deliver and operate, you may not have the operating margins
            to support even a third, and you may have to lower your CAC to an
            even smaller percentage of CLV to make your financial model
            work.</p></li></ul></div><p>What <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> drives your acquisition costs
        is your underlying business model. While there may not be an industry
        standard for acquisition, you should have some target margins that you
        need to achieve, and the percentage of your revenue that you spend on
        acquisition drives those margins. So when you’re deciding what to
        spend on customer acquisition, start with your business model.</p><div class="sect2" title="Bottom Line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="bottom_line-id00010">Bottom Line</h3></div></div></div><p>Unless you have a good reason to do otherwise, don’t spend
          more than a third of the money you expect to gain from a customer
          (and the customers she invites downstream) on acquiring that
          customer.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Virality"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="virality-id00011" style="clear: both">Virality</h2></div></div></div><p>Recall that virality is actually two metrics: how many new users
        each existing user successfully invites (your viral coefficient) and
        the time it takes her to do so (your viral cycle time). There’s no
        “normal” for virality. Both metrics depend on the nature of your
        product, as well as market saturation.</p><p>A sustained viral coefficient of greater than 1 is an extremely
        strong indicator of growth, and suggests that you should be focusing
        on stickiness so you can retain those new users as you add them. But
        even a lower viral coefficient is useful, because it effectively
        reduces your customer acquisition <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1067"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1328"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1362"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1545"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1644"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1648"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1798"/>cost. Imagine that it costs you $1,000 to acquire 100
        new users. Your CAC is therefore $10. But if you have a viral
        coefficient of 0.4, then those 100 users will invite 40 more, who will
        in turn invite an additional 16, and so on. In the end, those 100
        users are really 165 users. So your CAC is actually $6.06. Put another
        way, virality is a force multiplier for your attention-generating
        efforts. Done right, it’s one of your unfair advantages.</p><p>It’s also critical to distinguish between
        <span class="emphasis"><em>artificial</em></span> virality and
        <span class="emphasis"><em>inherent</em></span> virality. If your service is inherently
        viral—meaning that use of the product naturally involves inviting
        outsiders, as it does with products like Skype or Uberconf—the newly
        invited users have a legitimate reason to use the product. A Skype
        user you invite will join in order to get on a call with you. Users
        who join in this way will be more engaged than those invited in other,
        less intrinsic ways (for example, through a word-of-mouth
        mention).</p><p>On the other hand, if your virality is forced—for example, if
        you let people into a beta once they invite five friends, or reward
        people with extra features for tweeting something—you won’t see as
        much stickiness from the invited users. Dropbox found a clever way
        around this, by <span class="emphasis"><em>looking</em></span> inherent and giving away
        something of value (cloud storage) when it was in fact largely
        artificial. People invited others because they wanted more space for
        themselves, not because they needed to share content. Only later did
        the company add more advanced sharing features that made the virality
        more inherent.</p><p>Don’t overlook sharing by email, which, as mentioned in <a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Model Five: User-Generated Content">Chapter 12</a>, can represent nearly
        80% of all online sharing, particularly for media sites and older
        customers.</p><div class="sect2" title="Bottom Line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="bottom_line-id00012">Bottom Line</h3></div></div></div><p>There’s no “typical” virality for startups. If virality is
          below 1, it’s helping lower your customer acquisition cost. If it’s
          above 1, you’ll grow. And if you’re over 0.75, things are pretty
          good. Try to build inherent virality into the product, and track it
          against your business model. Treat artificial virality the same way
          you would customer acquisition, and segment it by the value of the
          new users it brings in.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Mailing List Effectiveness"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="mailing_list_effectiveness" style="clear: both">Mailing List Effectiveness</h2></div></div></div><p>Mailing list provider MailChimp shares a considerable amount of
        data on how well mailing lists work.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch21fn10" id="ch21fn10">85</a>]</sup> Mailing list open rates vary widely by <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1101"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1153"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1596"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1839"/>industry.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch21fn11" id="ch21fn11">86</a>]</sup> A 2010 study showed that construction, home and garden,
        and photo emails achieve nearly 30% open rate, but emails related to
        medicine, politics, and music get as little as 14%. And these are
        legitimate messages for which recipients have ostensibly signed up—not
        spam.</p><p>There’s plenty you can do to improve your email open rate.
        Targeting your mailings by tailoring messages to different segments of
        your subscriber base improves clicks and opens by nearly 15%. Email
        open rates change significantly based on the time of day—3 p.m., as it
        turns out, is when people are most likely to open something. Few
        people open emails on the weekend. More links in an email means more
        clicks. And newer subscribers are more likely to click on a
        message.</p><p>Jason Billingsley recommends testing an individualized send
        schedule equal to the signup time of the unique user. So, if a user
        signs up at 9 a.m., schedule to send her updates at 9 a.m. “Most email
        tools aren’t set up for such a tactic, but it’s a highly valuable test
        that could yield significant results,” he says.</p><p>But by far the biggest factor in mailing list effectiveness is
        simple: write a decent subject line. A good one gets an open rate of
        60–87%, and a bad one suffers a paltry 1–14%.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch21fn12" id="ch21fn12">87</a>]</sup> It turns out that simple, self-explanatory messages that
        include something about the recipient get opened. Sometimes it’s just
        one word: Experian reported that the word “exclusive” in email
        promotional campaigns increased unique open rates by 14%.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch21fn13" id="ch21fn13">88</a>]</sup></p><p>François Lane, CEO of mailing platform CakeMail, has a few
        additional cautions that underscore how email delivery metrics are
        interrelated:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The more frequently you email users, the lower your bounce
            and human-flagged spam rates (because those addresses quickly get
            removed from the list), but frequent emailing also tends to reduce
            engagement metrics like open rate and click-through rate, because
            recipients get email fatigue.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A higher rate of machine-flagged spam leads to a lower rate
            of human-flagged spam, because humans don’t complain about mail
            they don’t receive.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Open rate is a fundamentally flawed metric, because it
            relies on the mail client to load a hidden pixel—which most modern

This is one of the main reasons
            newsletter designers focus on imageless layout. Open rates are
            mainly useful for testing subject lines or different contact lists
            for a single campaign, but they provide only a sample, and at best
            a skewed one.</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2" title="Bottom Line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="bottom_line-id00013">Bottom Line</h3></div></div></div><p>Open and click-through rates will vary significantly, but a
          well-run campaign should hit a 20–30% open rate and over 5%

        on 10 different cloud providers showed that nearly 3% of tests to
        those clouds resulted in an error.<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.ch21fn14" id="ch21fn14">89</a>]</sup> So even if your site is working all the time, the
        Internet and the underlying infrastructure will cause problems.</p><p>Achieving an uptime of better than 99.95% is costly, too,
        allowing you to be down only 4.4 hours a year. If your users are loyal
        and engaged, then they’ll tolerate a small amount of
        downtime—particularly if you’re transparent about it on social
        networks and keep them informed.</p><div class="sect2" title="Bottom Line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="bottom_line-id00014">Bottom Line</h3></div></div></div><p>For a paid service that users rely on (such as an email
          application or a hosted project management application), you should
          have at least 99.5% uptime, and keep users updated about outages.
          Other kinds of applications can survive a lower level of

        downloads). In some cases (such as a transaction-focused e-commerce
        site), you want site visitors to come onto your site and engage
        quickly, whereas in other cases (such as a media site that monetizes
        via ads), you want visitors spending as much time as possible.</p><p>Analytics firm Chartbeat measures page engagement across a
        multitude of sites. It defines an “engaged” user as someone who has a
        page open and has scrolled, typed, or interacted with the page in the
        last few seconds. “We generally see a separation between how much
        engagement sites get <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1805"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2316"/>on landing pages—which typically get high traffic and
        low engagement—and other pages,” says Joshua Schwartz, a data
        scientist with the company. “Across my sample of sites, average
        engaged time on landing pages was 61 seconds and on non-landing pages
        it was 76 seconds. Of course, this varies widely between pages and
        between sites, but it’s a reasonable benchmark.”</p><div class="sect2" title="Bottom Line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="bottom_line-id00015">Bottom Line</h3></div></div></div><p>An average engaged time on a page of one minute is normal, but

        found that pages with very slow load times have very few concurrent
        users, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch21.html#after_about_10_seconds_of_load_timecomma" title="Figure 21-5. After about 10 seconds of load time, people don’t stick around">Figure 21-5</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="after_about_10_seconds_of_load_timecomma"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00057"/><img alt="After about 10 seconds of load time, people don’t stick around" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989324.png.jpg"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 21-5. After about 10 seconds of load time, people don’t stick

        seconds, where after that users simply won’t wait, and traffic falls
