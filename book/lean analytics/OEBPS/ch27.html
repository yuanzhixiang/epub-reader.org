      models: e-commerce (because they’re built around transactions between
      buyers and sellers) and user-generated content (because they rely on
      sellers to create and manage listings whose quality affects the revenue
      and health of the marketplace). This means there’s a combination of
      analytics you need to care about.</p><p>There is another reason analytics matter to marketplaces. Sellers
      seldom have the sophistication to analyze pricing, the effectiveness of
      their pictures, or what copy sells best. As the marketplace owner, you
      can help them with this analysis. In fact, you can do it better than
      they can, because you have access to the aggregate data from all sellers
      on the site.</p><p>An individual merchant might not know what price to charge. Even
      if he could do the analysis, he wouldn’t have enough data points. But
      since you have access to <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> transactions, you may
      be able to help him optimize pricing (and improve your revenues along
      the way). Airbnb did this kind of experimental optimization on behalf of
      its vendors when it tested the impact of paid photography services on
      rental rates—then rolled the service out to property owners.</p><p>We’ve looked at both the e-commerce and UGC models in other
      chapters, but here we’ll briefly consider some of the unique challenges
      faced by two-sided marketplaces.</p><div class="sect1" title="Transaction Size"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="transaction_size" style="clear: both">Transaction Size</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1357"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1425"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2210"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2224"/>Some marketplaces are for infrequent, big-ticket items
        (like houses), while others are for frequent, smaller items (like
        those listed on eBay). This means that the number of listings per
        seller, and the transaction price, vary widely, and a useful baseline
        is impossible.</p><p>There are often correlations between purchase size and
        conversion rate, however. The bigger a purchase, the more
        consideration and comparison go into it. Smaller purchases carry less
        risk, and may be more impulsive or whimsical than big ones.</p><div class="sect2" title="Bottom Line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="bottom_line-id00045">Bottom Line</h3></div></div></div><p>We can’t tell you what your typical transaction size will be,
          but we can tell you that you should measure it, along with
          conversion rates, to understand your buyers’ behavior—then pass this
          information along to sellers.</p></div></div><div class="sect1 case_study" title="What Etsy Watches"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_what_etsy_watches" style="clear: both">What Etsy Watches</h2></div></div></div><p>Etsy is an online store for creative types to share and sell
        their work. Founded in 2005 by a painter, a photographer, and a
        carpenter who had nowhere to sell their work online, the company now
        sells over half a billion dollars a year through its shared
        marketplace.</p><p>The company looks at a lot of metrics. It tracks revenue metrics
        such as shopping carts (individual sales), number of items sold, gross
        monthly sales, and total fees collected from those sales. It also
        looks at the growth of buyers and sellers by counting the number of
        new accounts, new sellers, and total confirmed accounts. Over time,
        the company has started tracking year-on-year increase in these core
        metrics.</p><p>Beyond these fundamentals, Etsy tracks the growth of individual
        product categories, time to first sale by a user, average order value,
        percentage of visits that convert to a sale, percentage of return
        buyers, and distinct sellers within a product category. It also breaks
        down time-to-first-sale and average order value by product
        category.</p><p>Recently, the company has started looking more closely at values
        like the total gross margin sold and percent of converting visits by
        mobile versus desktop, as well as the number of active sellers in a
        region. It’s also calculating smoothed historical averages that act as
        a baseline against which to identify any anomalies in the data.</p><p>Etsy VP of Engineering Kellan Elliott-McCrae says that for any
        given product, Etsy calculates a number of metrics, particularly
        within site search. The company runs its search system like any other
        ad network, <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1179"/>and “constantly measures demand (searches) and supply
        (items) for all the keywords passing through the system, making them
        available for purchase and pricing them when there is both demand and
        supply.”</p><p>When Etsy adopted a continuous deployment approach to
        engineering, its initial business dashboards included registrations
        per second, logins per second (against login errors), checkouts per
        second (against checkout errors), new and renewed listings, and
        “screwed users” (distinct users seeing an error message).
        “Importantly, these are all rate-based metrics designed to quickly
        highlight that we might have broken something,” says Kellan. “Later we
        added metrics like average and 95th percentile page-load times, and
        monitored for performance regressions.”</p><p>Most recently, Etsy has been trying to make it clear how various
        features contribute to a sale. “For example, we can attribute the
        percentage of sales that come directly from search, but we’ve found
        that visitors who first browse, and <span class="emphasis"><em>then</em></span> search,
        have a higher conversion rate,” says Kellan. “Of course, on the flip
        side, conversion rate is a very difficult metric to get statistical
        significance on, as purchases happen rarely enough that when analyzing
        them against the site-wide clickstream, you get anomalous
        results.”</p><p>Kellan points out that Etsy’s help pages have the best
        conversion rate for purchases anywhere on the site (because people go
        there when they’re trying to accomplish something), but jokes that the
        company hasn’t followed through on the logical product decision of
        making help pages the core site experience. “To get meaningful data,
        you really have to scope your experiments.”</p><p>Even with the site’s huge sales volume, the company hasn’t gone
        after rapid growth. “We play with a very narrow margin and so we’ve
        historically been very cautious about stepping on the gas rather than
        closely monitoring health metrics and growing sustainably,” he
        explains.</p><p>Because anticipating demand helps drive sales, the company sends
        out a monthly newsletter to sellers, which discusses analytical data,
        market research, and historical trends. The company also has a market
        research tool for sellers. “If a seller were to search for ‘desk’,”
        explains Kellan, “they could check out the market research tool to see
        that ‘desk calendars’ generally sell in the $20–$24 range, a
        downloadable desk calendar PDF sells in the $4 range, desk lamps sell
        in roughly the $50 range, and only a handful of actual desks are sold
        each day.”</p><p>Etsy is a shared marketplace, but it overcame the
        chicken-and-egg issues that two-sided markets face through
        serendipity. “Initially our buyers and sellers were the same people.
        We made this explicit in the <a class="indexterm" id="iddle2206"/>beginning by encouraging the sale of both crafts and
        craft supplies,” says Kellan. “Etsy was deeply embedded in a community
        of makers who supported each other, and initially we were helping them
        find one another.”</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Etsy is metrics-driven, but those metrics have become
            increasingly business-focused as it’s moved past product/market
            fit.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The company sidestepped the chicken-and-egg problem most
            marketplaces face because initially, its buyers were also
            sellers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Analytics are also shared with vendors, in order to help
            them sell more successfully—which in turn helps Etsy.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Analytics Lessons
        Learned</strong></span></p><p>The buyer/seller model in a shared marketplace is a lot like
        inventory in an advertising network. Knowing what buyers want, and how
        well you’re meeting that demand, is an early indicator of what your
        revenues will be like. And because you want to help your sellers, you
        should selectively share analytical data with them that will make them
        better at selling.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Top 10 Lists"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="top_10_lists" style="clear: both">Top 10 Lists</h2></div></div></div><p>Top 10 lists are a good way to start understanding how your
        marketplace is working. Run some queries of KPIs like revenue and
        number of transactions according to product segments:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Who are your top 10 buyers?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Who are your top 10 sellers?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What products or categories generate the majority of your
            revenues?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What price ranges, times of day, and days of week experience
            peak sales?</p></li></ul></div><p>It might seem simple, but making lists of the top 10 segments or
        categories, and looking at what’s changing, will give you qualitative
        insights into the health of your marketplace that you can later turn
        into quantitative tests, and then innovations.</p><div class="sect2" title="Bottom Line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="bottom_line-id00046">Bottom Line</h3></div></div></div><p>Unlike a traditional e-commerce company, you don’t have a lot
          of control over inventory and listings. But what you
          <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> have is insight into what is selling well,
          so you can go and get more like it. If you find that a particular
          product category, geographic region, house size, or color is selling
          well, you can encourage those sellers—and find more like
          them.</p></div></div></section></body></html>
