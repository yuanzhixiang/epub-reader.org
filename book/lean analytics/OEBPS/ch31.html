      You’ve found product/market fit, and you’re scaling even as your growth
      slows to that of a big company. But hopefully you’re still analytical.
      Hopefully you’re still thinking in terms of learning, and continuous
      improvement, and demanding that data back up your opinions.</p><p>Your startup has succeeded when it’s a sustainable, repeatable
      business that can generate a return to its founders and investors. It
      might take on additional funding at this point, but the purpose of the
      funding is no longer to identify and mitigate uncertainties, it’s to
      execute on a proven business model. Data becomes less about optimization
      and more about accounting. If there are “lean analytics” going on,
      they’re probably in new product or feature discovery, and look more like
      intrapreneur innovation.</p><p>We started by saying that if you can’t measure something, you
      can’t manage it. But there’s a contrary, perhaps more philosophical,
      observation we need to consider. It’s a line by Lloyd S. Nelson, who
      worked at Nashua Corporation. “The most important figures that one needs
      for management are unknown or unknowable, but successful management must
      nevertheless take account of them.” This smacks of Donald Rumsfeld’s
      “unknown unknowns,” and as your company grows and achieves a degree of
      operational consistency, figuring out what you
      <span class="emphasis"><em>don’t</em></span> know becomes a key task of management.</p><p>Nelson’s point was that we often do things without knowing they’ll
      work. That’s called experimentation. But experimentation—for companies
      of any size—succeeds only if it’s part of a process of continuous
      learning, one we hope to have instilled in you whatever the size or
      stage of your business.</p><div class="sect1" title="How to Instill a Culture of Data in Your Company"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="how_to_instill_a_culture_of_data_in_your" style="clear: both">How to Instill a Culture of Data in Your Company</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1847"/>If you’re a leader—the founder of a startup, or a
        C-level executive in a large enterprise—you can turn analytics into a
        competitive advantage simply by asking good questions. Earlier in the
        book we said that a good metric is one that drives decision making. As
        a leader within your organization, demand proof through data before
        making decisions.</p><p>Data doesn’t just lead to better decisions. It also improves
        organizational efficiency. You can create a flatter, more autonomous
        organization once everyone buys in to a data-informed approach,
        because rather than needing to propagate an opinion across the
        organization, you can let the facts speak for themselves. You can
        empower employees to make more decisions and take on more
        responsibility once they’ve got the data in place to support them.
        Create a culture of accountability, and then reward those who step up
        and deliver.</p><p>Whether you’re in a leadership position or not, you can make
        your organization more data-centric. Here’s how.</p><div class="sect2" title="Start Small, Pick One Thing, and Show Value"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="start_smallcomma_pick_one_thingcomma_and">Start Small, Pick One Thing, and Show Value</h3></div></div></div><p>There will always be naysayers in an organization who believe
          instinct, gut, and “the way we’ve always done business” are good
          enough. The best thing you can do is pick a small but significant
          problem your company faces (take any single metric of importance, be
          it churn, percent daily active users, website conversions, etc.) and
          work to improve it through analytics.</p><p>Don’t go after the most crucial issue your company is
          facing—that’s likely got too many cooks in the kitchen already (or
          worse, it’s mired in politics you don’t want to wade into). Instead,
          pick an ancillary issue, something that can add demonstrable
          business value but is being overlooked.</p><p>This approach, if taken too far, can lead to silos within the
          company, and that’s a bad thing. Once you’ve demonstrated the
          benefits with one issue, roll out the process across all departments
          and product areas.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Make Sure Goals Are Clearly Understood"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="make_sure_goals_are_clearly_understood">Make Sure Goals Are Clearly Understood</h3></div></div></div><p>To prove the value of an analytics-focused company, any
          project you take on needs to have clear goals. If you don’t have a
          goal in mind (including a line in the sand that you’ve drawn),
          you’ll fail. Everyone involved in the project needs to be aligned
          around the goals.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Get Executive Buy-in"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="get_executive_buy-in">Get Executive Buy-in</h3></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1139"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1519"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1834"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2181"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2211"/>Unless you’re the CEO and pushing this approach
          top-down, you’ll need executive buy-in. For example, if you want to
          improve the conversion of website visitors signing up for your free
          trial software application, make sure the person in charge of
          marketing is on board. This person’s buy-in will be critical in
          aligning goals, but also in driving the culture up and down the
          corporate ladder.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Make Things Simple to Digest"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="make_things_simple_to_digest">Make Things Simple to Digest</h3></div></div></div><p>A good metric is one that’s easy to understand at a glance.
          Don’t overwhelm people with a firehose of numbers. They’ll get
          frustrated, and they’re also very likely to start looking at the
          wrong things, focusing on the wrong numbers, and making decisions
          without understanding what they’re looking at. Metrics can be
          extremely valuable, but used incorrectly they’ll lead down the wrong
          path.</p><p>Remember the One Metric That Matters. Use that principle as a
          way of easing people into analytics and number crunching.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Ensure Transparency"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="ensure_transparency">Ensure Transparency</h3></div></div></div><p>If you’re going to use data to make decisions, it’s important
          that you share the data and the methodologies used to acquire and
          process it. Decision-making frameworks are needed so that your
          company can find repeatable strategies for the use of analytics (and
          lessen the “flying by the seat of our pants” approach that companies
          often take). Transparency (in both success and failure) is important
          for breaking down the data silos and people’s preconceived notions
          about analytics.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Don’t Eliminate Your Gut"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="donapostrophet_eliminate_your_gut">Don’t Eliminate Your Gut</h3></div></div></div><p>As we’ve said before, Lean Analytics isn’t about eliminating
          your gut, it’s about proving your gut right or wrong. Accenture
          Chief Scientist Kishore Swaminathan says, “Science is purely
          empirical and dispassionate, but scientists are not. Science is
          objective and mechanical, but it also values scientists who are
          creative, intuitive, and who can take a leap of faith.”<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch31fn01" id="ch31fn01">172</a>]</sup></p><p>You can help push your company’s culture by making sure you
          balance people’s notion that instinct and gut are enough with small,
          data-driven experiments, proving the value of analytics while not
          completely eliminating the benefits of instinct.</p><p>Instilling change in any size organization takes time. You
          can’t expect a company to change the way it does business and makes
          decisions overnight. Start small, and find experiments you can box
          in easily and which generate measurable results quickly. Prove the
          value of analytics in moving your company’s KPIs (even a little
          bit), and you’ll be able to make the case for an analytics-focused
          shift. Use concepts like the One Metric That Matters and tools like
          the Problem-Solution Canvas to make analytics approachable and
          understandable for everyone, not just the data scientists. Get
          people focused on lines in the sand—measurable targets that everyone
          (including executives) agrees to—so that you can demonstrate
          results.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Ask Good Questions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="ask_good_questions">Ask Good Questions</h3></div></div></div><p>There’s never been a better time to know your market. Your
          customers leave a trail of digital breadcrumbs with every click,
          tweet, vote, like, share, check-in, and purchase, from the first
          time they hear about you until the day they leave you forever,
          whether they’re online or off. If you know how to collect those
          breadcrumbs, you have unprecedented insight into their needs, their
          quirks, and their lives.</p><p>This insight is forever changing what it means to be a
          business leader. Once, a leader convinced others to act in the
          absence of information. Today, there’s simply too much information
          available. We don’t need to guess—we need to know where to focus. We
          need a disciplined approach to growth that identifies, quantifies,
          and overcomes risk every step of the way. Today’s leader doesn’t
          have all the answers. Instead, today’s leader knows what questions
          to ask.</p><p>Go forth and <span class="emphasis"><em>ask good questions</em></span>.</p></div></div><div class="footnotes" epub:type="footnotes"><br/><hr style="width: 100; align: left;"/><div class="footnote" id="ftn.ch31fn01"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#ch31fn01">172</a>] </sup><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.accenture.com/us-en/outlook/Pages/outlook-journal-2011-edge-csuite-analytics.aspx" target="_top">http://www.accenture.com/us-en/outlook/Pages/outlook-journal-2011-edge-csuite-analytics.aspx</a></em></span></p></div></div></section></body></html>
