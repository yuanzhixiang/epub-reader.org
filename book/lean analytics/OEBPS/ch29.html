      businesses? Think again.</p><p>Sure, it’s easier to experiment on consumers—there are so many of
      them out there, and they make decisions irrationally, so you can toy
      with their emotions. There’s no doubt that cloud computing and social
      media have made it easy to launch something and spread the word without
      significant upfront investment, and consumer startups are media icons,
      even fodder for Hollywood.<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.ch29fn01" id="ch29fn01">136</a>]</sup> Even business-to-business startups, such as SaaS
      providers, often target small and medium companies.</p><p>But a data-informed approach to business is good for any kind of
      organization. Plenty of great founders went after big business problems,
      and got rich doing so. As TechCrunch reporter Alex Williams put it,
      “While the enterprise can be as boring as hell, the whole goddamn thing
      is paved with gold.”<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch29fn02" id="ch29fn02">137</a>]</sup> Enterprise-focused startups do have to deal with some
      unique challenges along the way, which changes the metrics they watch
      and how they collect them, but it’s worth it.</p><div class="sect1" title="Why Are Enterprise Customers Different?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="why_are_enterprise_customers_differentqu" style="clear: both">Why Are Enterprise Customers Different?</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1413"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1530"/>Let’s start with the good news: it’s easier to find
        enterprises to talk to. They’re in the phone book. They might have
        time for coffee. They have budgets. And for many of the people in
        these organizations, it’s part of their <span class="emphasis"><em>job</em></span> to
        evaluate new solutions, meet with vendors, and share their needs to
        see if someone can solve them more explicitly. Armed with a decent
        caffeine allowance, you can talk to actual prospects fairly
        quickly.</p><p>That said, there are plenty of important ways that enterprise
        sales are different and more difficult than selling to a large,
        unwashed audience. Venture capitalist Ben Horowitz was one of the
        first to burst this bubble:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Every day I hear from entrepreneurs, angel investors, and
          venture capitalists about an exciting new movement called “the
          consumerization of the enterprise.” They tell me how the old,
          expensive, Rolex-wearing sales forces are a thing of the past and,
          in the future, companies will “consume” enterprise products
          proactively like consumers pick up Twitter.</p><p>But when I talk to the most successful new enterprise
          companies like WorkDay, Apptio, Jive, Zuora, and Cloudera, they all
          employ serious and large enterprise sales efforts that usually
          include expensive people, some of whom indeed wear Rolex
          watches.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch29fn03" id="ch29fn03">138</a>]</sup></p></blockquote></div><div class="sect2" title="Big Ticket, High Touch"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="big_ticketcomma_high_touch">Big Ticket, High Touch</h3></div></div></div><p>The one thing that makes enterprise-focused startups different
          is this: B2C customer development is polling, B2B customer
          development is a census.</p><p>In most cases, enterprise sales involve bigger-ticket items,
          sold to fewer customers. That means more money from fewer sources.
          If you’re selling a big-ticket item, this changes the game
          dramatically. For starters, you can afford to talk to every
          customer. The high sale price offsets the cost of a direct sales
          approach, particularly in the early stages of the sale.</p><p>The small number of initial users makes an even bigger
          difference. You aren’t talking to a sample of 30 people as a proxy
          for the market at large. Instead, you’re talking to 30 companies who
          may well become your first 30 customers.</p><p>Much of analytics is about trying to understand large amounts
          of information so you can get a better grasp of underlying patterns
          and act on <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1414"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1617"/>them. But in the early stages of a B2B startup, there
          aren’t patterns—there are just customers.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>You can pick up the phone and call them right away.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They’ll call you and tell you what they want.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You can get in a room with them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You can’t test something on a statistically significant
              sample of the population and write it off if the test
              fails—you’ll lose customers.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Formality"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="formality">Formality</h3></div></div></div><p>Enterprise buyers tend to be more regulated. They can’t make
          decisions on gut or emotion—or rather, they can, but it has to be
          justified with a business case. Big companies are often public
          companies with checks and balances. The person who pays for the
          product (finance) isn’t the person who uses it (the line of
          business). Understanding this dichotomy is critical for product
          development and sales. Initially, you may target early adopters,
          where the buyer is much closer to the user (they may be the same
          person at this point), but as you move past early adopters, the
          buyer and user diverge.</p><p>Companies have formal structure for good reasons. It helps
          prevent corruption, and makes auditing possible. But that structure
          gets in the way of understanding things. Your contact at a company
          may be a proponent, but someone else in the organization may be a
          detractor, or have a concern of which you’re not aware. This is one
          of the reasons direct sales is common in early stages: it lets you
          navigate the bureaucracy and understand the part of the sales
          process that’s hidden to outsiders.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Legacy Products"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="legacy_products" style="clear: both">Legacy Products</h2></div></div></div><p>Consumers can ditch their old product on a whim. Small
        businesses can migrate fairly easily, as the recent exodus to
        cloud-based software demonstrates. Large companies, on the other hand,
        have a significant capital investment in the past which must be
        properly depreciated. They also have a significant political
        investment in past decisions, and often this is the strongest
        opposition to change.</p><p>Most organizations of any real size have developed their own
        software and processes, and they expect you to adapt to them. They
        won’t change how they work: change is hard, and retraining is a cost.
        This can increase your deployment costs, because you have to integrate
        with what’s already in place. It also means your products must be more
        configurable and adaptable, which translates into more complexity and
        less ease of use.</p><div class="sect2" title="Incumbents"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="incumbents">Incumbents</h3></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1618"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1620"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1863"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2354"/>Those legacy issues are part of another
          problem—incumbents. If you’re trying to disrupt or replace
          something, you’ll have to convince the organization that you’re
          better, despite the efforts of an existing solution. Organizations
          are averse to change, and love the status quo. If you’re trying to
          sell to them, and your product is still in the early stages of the
          technology adoption cycle, you’re penalized simply for being new.
          <span class="emphasis"><em>Consumers love novelty; businesses just call it
          risk</em></span>.</p><p>This also means incumbent vendors can stall your sale
          significantly if they get wind of what you’re planning to do just by
          claiming that they’re going to do it too. They can step on your
          oxygen hose by promising something—then rescind the promise once
          you’re dead.</p><p>Of course, big, slow incumbents have plenty of weaknesses. New
          entrants can disrupt their market simply by being easier to adopt,
          because they require no training. A decade ago, the only people who
          knew what a “feed” was were stock traders connecting to Bloomberg
          terminals; today, everyone who’s used Facebook or Twitter is
          familiar with feeds. They don’t need to be trained.</p><p>Simplicity isn’t just an attribute of enterprise
          disruption—it’s the price of entry. DJ Patil, data scientist in
          residence at Greylock and former head of product at LinkedIn, calls
          this the Zero Overhead Principle:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A central theme to this new wave of innovation is the
            application of core product tenets from the consumer space to the
            enterprise. In particular, a universal lesson that I keep sharing
            with all entrepreneurs building for the enterprise is the Zero
            Overhead Principle: no feature may add training costs to the
            user.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch29fn04" id="ch29fn04">139</a>]</sup></p></blockquote></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Slower Cycle Time"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="slower_cycle_time">Slower Cycle Time</h3></div></div></div><p>Lean Startup models work because they empower you to learn
          quickly and iteratively. It’s hard to achieve speed when your
          customer moves sluggishly and carefully, so the slower cycle time of
          your target market makes it tough to iterate quickly. This is a key
          reason why many of the early Lean Startup success stories have come
          from consumer-focused businesses.</p><p>The rise of the SaaS market changes this, because it’s
          relatively easy to alter functionality without the market’s
          permission. But if you’re selling traditional enterprise software,
          or delivery trucks, or shredders, you’re not going to learn and
          iterate as quickly as you would from consumers. Of <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1172"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1315"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1320"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1537"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1548"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1619"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1894"/>course, your competitors aren’t either. You don’t need
          to be fast—just faster than everyone else.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Rationality (and Lack of Imagination)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="rationality_left_parenthesisand_lack_of">Rationality (and Lack of Imagination)</h3></div></div></div><p>Not all companies fit the stereotype of the big, slow,
          late-adopter customer, but risk aversion is real. Because enterprise
          buyers can’t take the risks consumers can, they limit their own
          thinking. They demand proof that something will work before they try
          it out, which means great ideas can often become mired in business
          cases, return-on-investment analyses, and total-cost-of-ownership
          spreadsheets.</p><p>This rationality is warranted. In 2005, IEEE (Institute of
          Electrical and Electronics Engineers) committee chair Robert N.
          Charette estimated that of the $1 trillion spent on software each
          year, 5–15% would be abandoned before or shortly after delivery, and
          much of the rest would be late or suffer huge budget
          overruns.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch29fn05" id="ch29fn05">140</a>]</sup> A similar study by PM Solutions estimates that 37% of
          IT projects are at risk.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch29fn06" id="ch29fn06">141</a>]</sup></p><p>Because companies are full of people—for many of whom their
          job is just a job—their priority is to minimize the chance of them
          making a mistake even if the organization as a whole might suffer in
          the long term. It’s hard to inspire an organization if its employees
          are busy wondering whether the changes you promise will cost them
          their jobs.</p><p>This is an unnecessarily bleak view of the world.</p><p>For all these reasons, most B2B-focused startups consist of
          two people: a domain expert and a disruption expert.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The domain expert knows the industry and the problem
              domain. He has a Rolodex and can act as a proxy for customers in
              the early stages of product definition. Often this person is
              from the line of business, and has a marketing, sales, or
              business development role.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The disruption expert knows the technology that will
              produce a change on which the startup can capitalize. She can
              see beyond the current model and understand what an industry
              will look like after the shift, and brings the novel approach to
              the existing market. This is usually the technologist.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="The Enterprise Startup Lifecycle"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="enterprise_startup_lifecycle" style="clear: both">The Enterprise Startup Lifecycle</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1080"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1416"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1418"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1420"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1886"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2185"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2338"/>Startups begin in many ways. Over the years, however,
        we’ve seen a recurring pattern in how B2B startups grow. It usually
        happens in one of three ways:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>The enterprise pivot</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>In this pattern, the company creates a popular consumer
              product, then pivots to tackle the enterprise. This is what
              Dropbox did, and to some extent it’s the way BlackBerry
              circumvented enterprise IT by targeting mercenary salespeople.
              It’s not trivial, though: enterprises have very different
              expectations and concerns from consumers.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Copy and rebuild</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>Another approach is to take a consumer idea and make it
              enterprise-ready. Yammer did this when it rebuilt Facebook’s
              status update model and copied Facebook’s feed interface.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Disrupt an existing problem</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>There are plenty of disruptions that happen to an
              industry, from the advent of mobile data, to the Internet of
              Things,<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch29fn07" id="ch29fn07">142</a>]</sup> to the adoption of the fax machine, to
              location-aware applications. Any of them can offer a big enough
              advantage to make it worth discarding the old way of doing
              things. Taleo did this to the traditional business of human
              resources management.</p></dd></dl></div><div class="sect2" title="Inspiration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="inspiration">Inspiration</h3></div></div></div><p>Many of the enterprise startups we’ve talked to began with a
          basic idea, often hatched within the ecosystem they wanted to
          disrupt. That’s because domain knowledge is essential. Important
          elements of how a business works—particularly back-office
          operations—are hidden from the outside world. It’s only by being an
          insider that the bottlenecks become painfully obvious.</p><p>Take the founders of Taleo. They left enterprise requirements
          planning (ERP) heavyweight BAAN to bring talent management tools to
          the enterprise. They had seen that the big challenges of ERP were
          integration and deployment, and they’d realized that the Web was how
          many organizations connect with candidates. They also saw that
          talent management, both before and after hires were made, was
          increasingly data-driven.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1244"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1374"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1419"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2072"/>Many of their realizations came from seeing technology
          trends. But the founders’ fundamental knowledge of the HR industry
          came from their time at BAAN. Clearly, it worked out well: in
          February 2012, Oracle acquired Taleo for $1.9 billion.</p><p>That doesn’t mean the founding team <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span>
          include an insider—but it helps. Remember, though, insiders still
          need to “get out of the building” and validate their assumptions;
          not doing so because of existing domain expertise can be
          disastrous.</p><p>Let’s look at how the five stages of the Lean Analytics
          framework apply to a B2B-focused company. <a class="xref" href="ch29.html#lean_analytics_stages_when_youapostrophe" title="Figure 29-1. The Lean Analytics stages when you’re selling to enterprises">Figure 29-1</a> shows what a
          B2B company needs to do at each stage, as well as what risks it
          should fear.</p><div class="figure"><a id="lean_analytics_stages_when_youapostrophe"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00066"/><img alt="The Lean Analytics stages when you’re selling to enterprises" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989333.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 29-1. The Lean Analytics stages when you’re selling to

          organizations. Consulting is a good way to discover customer needs,
          and it helps pay the bills. It also gives you a way to test out your
          early ideas, because while every customer has needs, the only needs
          you can build a business on are those that are consistent across a
          reasonably large, addressable market.</p><p>Having said that, consulting companies struggle a great deal
          to transition from service providers to product companies because
          they need to, at some point, abandon service revenues and focus on
          the product. That transition <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1110"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1270"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1370"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1412"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1652"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1758"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1784"/>can be extremely painful—from a cash flow
          perspective—and most service providers don’t make the jump.</p><p>It’s also necessary to “burn the boats” of the services
          business to ensure that you commit to the product. After all, you’re
          going to neglect some of your most-loved customers in order to
          deliver a product the general market wants instead, and it’ll be
          tempting to do custom work to keep them happy. You can’t run a
          product and a services business concurrently. Even IBM had to split
          itself in two; what makes you think you can do it as a fledgling
          startup?</p></div></div><div class="sect1 case_study" title="How Coradiant Found a Market"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_how_coradiant_found_a_market" style="clear: both">How Coradiant Found a Market</h2></div></div></div><p>Coradiant, a maker of web performance equipment, started in 1997
        as Networkshop, and was acquired by BMC Software in April
        2011.<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.ch29fn08" id="ch29fn08">143</a>]</sup> Initially it was an IT infrastructure consulting firm
        that wrote studies on performance, availability, and web technologies
        like SSL.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch29fn09" id="ch29fn09">144</a>]</sup> Soon, however, enterprises and startups approached the
        company seeking help with their deployments. These customers needed
        several pieces of costly network infrastructure—a pair of load
        balancers, firewalls, crypto accelerators, switches, routers, and
        related monitoring tools that, together, cost up to $500,000 and
        handled 100 megabits per second (Mbps) of traffic. But these companies
        needed only a fraction of that capacity.</p><p>Networkshop built a virtualized front-end infrastructure that
        customers could buy one Mbps at a time. It deployed this in a single
        data center in one city, and offered fractional capacity to customers
        in that data center. The economics were good: once the infrastructure
        had exceeded 35% utilization by customers, every additional dollar
        went straight to the bottom line.</p><p>Armed with this example, Networkshop changed its name to
        Coradiant and closed Series A funding, using the proceeds to deploy
        similar “pods” of infrastructure in data centers throughout North
        America. Wrapping this in support services, the company joined firms
        like LoudCloud and SiteSmith in the growing managed service provider
        (MSP) business.</p><p>Within a few years, however, the data center owners with whom
        Coradiant had colocated realized that they needed to make more
        <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1851"/>money from their facilities. To increase their revenue
        per square foot, they started offering competing services. The
        Coradiant founders had a decision to make: either compete head-to-head
        with the very same data centers in which their customers were hosted—a
        bad idea—or pivot to a new model that didn’t need the data center
        owners’ permission.</p><p>Coradiant had built a monitoring service (called OutSight) to
        help manage customers’ infrastructure and measure performance. In the
        summer of 2003, the company scaled back dramatically, laying off most
        operational staff and hiring developers and architects who focused on
        building an appliance version of this technology. The new product,
        dubbed TrueSight, launched in 2004, and this time, Coradiant didn’t
        need the data center owners’ permission to be deployed.</p><p>Some of Coradiant’s MSP customers became TrueSight users,
        quickly building a stable of reference-worthy household names. The
        initial version of TrueSight contained only basic features—most
        reporting, for example, was done by exporting information into Excel.
        But Coradiant had an extremely hands-on pre- and post-sales
        engineering team that worked closely with early customers. Once the
        company saw what kinds of reports customers made, and how they used
        the appliance, it incorporated those into later versions.</p><p>Coradiant didn’t use channel sales until the product was
        relatively mature. The direct contact helped provide frequent feedback
        from the field. The company also held user conferences twice a year to
        hear how people were using the product, which led it into new
        directions such as real-time visualization and data export for
        vulnerability detection.</p><p>Ultimately, the consulting heritage gave Coradiant insight into
        the needs of a target market. The initial product offering was based
        on the sharing of IT infrastructure, amortizing the cost of networking
        components across many customers. That service, in turn, helped the
        firm learn what features customers needed from a monitoring product,
        and ultimately led it to build the product for which it was
        acquired.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Coradiant started selling managed services, but a major

        competition mean that validated business assumptions are no longer
        true. When that happens, look at what your core value proposition is
        and see if you can sell it to a different market or in a different way
        that overcomes those changes—in this case, keeping only a subset of a
        service and delivering it as an appliance.</p><p>Launching a startup as a consultancy has its risks. It’s easy to
        get trapped in consulting. As the business grows, you’ll want to keep
        customers happy, and won’t have the cycles to dedicate to building the
        product or service you want. Many startups have lost sight of their
        initial plan and are now consulting firms—some of them happily. But
        they don’t meet Paul Graham’s test for scalable, repeatable, rapid
        growth. They’re not startups.</p><p>What’s more, in order to make the shift from consultancy to
        startup, you first need to test whether your existing customers’
        demands are applicable to a broader audience. Doing so may violate
        privacy agreements you have with your customers, so you need to
        finesse customer development. Your existing clients may feel that a
        standardized product you plan to offer will be less tailored to their
        needs; you need to convince them that a standard product is in fact
        better for them, because the cost of building future versions will be
        shared among many buyers.</p><p>Once you’ve found the problem you’re going to fix, and have
        verified that the solution will work with your prospects and clients,
        you need to segment them. Not all clients are identical, so it’s smart
        to pick a geographic region, a particular vertical, or customers who
        belong to just one of your sales teams. That way, you can give those
        early adopters better attention and limit the impact of
        failure.</p><p>Imagine, for example, that you’re building a hiring management
        tool. The way that a legal firm finds and retains candidates is very
        different from the way a fast-food restaurant does it. Trying to build
        a single tool for them—particularly at the outset—is a bad idea.
        Everything from the number of interviews, to the qualifications
        needed, to the number of years someone stays with the company will be
        different. Differences mean customization and parameters, which
        increase complexity, and violates DJ Patil’s Zero Overhead
        Principle.</p><div class="sect2" title="Stickiness: Standardization and Integration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="stickiness_standardization_and_integrati">Stickiness: Standardization and Integration</h3></div></div></div><p>Once you know the need and have identified your initial
          segments, you have to standardize the product. With some products,
          it’s possible to sell <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1421"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1424"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1789"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1957"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1979"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1995"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2301"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2334"/>before building. Instead of an MVP, you may have a
          prototype, or a set of specifications for which the prospect will
          commit to paying on delivery. This pipeline of conditional purchases
          reduces the cost of fundraising, because it increases the chances of
          success.</p><p>In the B2C world, startups worry less about “Can I build it?”
          and more about “Will anyone care?” In the enterprise market, the
          risk is more, “Will it integrate?” Integration with existing tools,
          processes, and environments is the most likely source of problems,
          and you’ll wind up customizing for clients—which undermines the
          standardization you fought so hard to achieve earlier.</p><p>Managing this tension between customization and
          standardization is one of the biggest challenges of an early-stage
          enterprise startup. If you can’t get the client’s users to try the
          product, you’re doomed. And while your technology might work, if it
          doesn’t properly integrate with legacy systems, it’ll be seen as
          your fault, not theirs.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Virality: Word of Mouth, Referrals, and References"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="virality_word_of_mouthcomma_referralscom">Virality: Word of Mouth, Referrals, and References</h3></div></div></div><p>Assuming you’ve successfully sold the standardized product to
          an initial market segment, you’ll need to grow. Because enterprises
          don’t trust newcomers, you’ll rely heavily on referrals and
          word-of-mouth marketing. You’ll make case studies from early
          successes, and ask satisfied users to handle phone calls from new
          prospects.</p><p>Referrals and references are critical to this stage of growth.
          A couple of household names as customers are priceless.
          Enterprise-focused vendors will often provide discounts in exchange

          about cash flow and commission structures for your direct sales
          team. To know if you have a sustainable business, you’ll also look
          at support costs, churn, trouble tickets, and other indicators of
          ongoing business costs to learn just how much a particular customer
          contributes to the bottom line. If the operating margin is bad, it
          will have a significant drag on profitability.</p><p>Feedback from the sales team and the support group is critical
          at this point, because it indicates whether your initial success is
          genuine, or simply a case of prospects buying into the story you’re
          telling (which won’t be sustainable in the longer term). Zach Nies,
          Chief Technologist at Rally Software says, “This is absolutely
          critical for startups, because they have a huge advantage here. In
          most incumbents, the product development team is so far removed from
          the field and customers that they have no sense of trends in the
          market. <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1263"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1395"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1415"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1422"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1457"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1691"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1934"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2045"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2258"/>Often startups will know a lot more about an
          incumbent’s customers than the incumbent does.”</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Scale: Channel Sales, Efficiencies, and Ecosystems"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="scale_channel_salescomma_efficienciescom">Scale: Channel Sales, Efficiencies, and Ecosystems</h3></div></div></div><p>In the final stages of an enterprise-focused startup, you’ll
          emphasize scaling. You may have channel sales through value-added
          resellers and distributors. You’ll also have an ecosystem of
          analysts, developers, APIs (application programming interfaces) and
          platforms, partners, and competitors that will define and refine the
          market. These are all good indicators that companies will keep using
          you, because they’re investing in processes, vendor relationships,
          and technology that will make it harder for them to leave you.
          Scaling an enterprise software company takes years to accomplish.
          Zach estimates that it can be as long as 5 to 10 years before a
          company selling into the enterprise has established and validated
          channels, and mastered its sales processes.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="So What Metrics Matter?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="so_what_metrics_matterquestion_mark" style="clear: both">So What Metrics Matter?</h2></div></div></div><p>Just as there are plenty of parallels between the way B2C and
        B2B startups grow, so many of the metrics we’ve seen for
        consumer-focused companies apply equally well to enterprise-focused
        ones. But there are a few metrics that you’ll want to consider that
        apply more to enterprise startups.</p><div class="sect2" title="Ease of Customer Engagement and Feedback"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="ease_of_customer_engagement_and_feedback">Ease of Customer Engagement and Feedback</h3></div></div></div><p>As you’re talking to customers, how easy is it to get meetings
          with them? If you plan to use a direct sales organization later on,
          this is an early indicator of what it’ll be like to sell the
          product.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Pipeline for Initial Releases, Betas, and Proof-of-Concept Trials"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="pipeline_for_initial_releasescomma_betas">Pipeline for Initial Releases, Betas, and Proof-of-Concept
          Trials</h3></div></div></div><p>As you start to sign up prospects, you’ll track the usual
          sales metrics. Unlike B2C platforms where you’re looking at
          subscription and engagement, if you’re selling a big-ticket,
          long-term item, you’re looking at contracts. While you may not have
          recognizable revenue, you’ll have lead volume and bookings to
          analyze, and these should give you an understanding of the cost of
          sales once the product has launched.</p><p>It’s important—right from the very beginning—that you
          articulate the stages of your sales funnel and the conversion rates
          at each point along the way. The sales cycle needs to be well
          documented, measured, and understood after the first few sales, to
          see if you can build a repeatable approach. At that point, you can
          bring in additional salespeople to increase volume.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Stickiness and Usability"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="stickiness_and_usability">Stickiness and Usability</h3></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1549"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2157"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2204"/>As we’ve seen, the usability of a disruptive solution
          is “table stakes” for a new entrant in today’s market. Companies
          expect ease of use, because they didn’t have to get trained on
          Google or Facebook, and thus shouldn’t have to get training from
          you, either. DJ Patil suggests using data to find where the friction
          is hiding in your usage and adoption. “If you can’t measure it, you
          can’t fix it,” he says. “Instrument the product to monitor user
          flows and be able to test new ideas in how to iteratively improve
          your product.”</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Integration Costs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="integration_costs">Integration Costs</h3></div></div></div><p>In the heat of the moment, it’s hard to take notes, but
          integration plays such a big role in enterprise sales that you have
          to be disciplined about measuring it. What’s the true cost of pre-
          and post-sales support? How much customization is required? How much
          training, explaining, and troubleshooting are you doing in order to
          successfully deliver a product to a customer?</p><p>You need to capture this data early on, because later it’s an
          indicator of whether you’ve built a startup or just created a highly
          standardized consulting practice. If you prematurely accelerate the
          latter, thinking it’s the former, supporting an expanded market and
          a sales channel will crush you. This data can also be used against
          incumbents in a total-cost-of-ownership analysis.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="User Engagement"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="user_engagement">User Engagement</h3></div></div></div><p>No matter what you’re building, the most important metric is
          whether people are using it. In an enterprise, however, the buyer is
          less likely to be the user. That means your contact may be an IT
          project manager, someone in purchasing, or an executive, but your
          actual users may be rank-and-file employees with whom you have no
          contact.</p><p>You may also have to refrain from talking to users: it’s easy
          to pop up a survey on a consumer website, but employers may frown
          upon you using up their employees’ precious time to answer your
          questions.</p><p>Simply measuring metrics like “time since last use” will be
          misleading, too, because users are <span class="emphasis"><em>paid</em></span> to use
          your tool. They may log in every day because it’s their job to do
          so; that doesn’t mean they enjoy it. The real questions are whether
          they <span class="emphasis"><em>like</em></span> logging in, and whether it makes them
          more productive. Users have a task they want to accomplish, and your
          product will thrive if it is the perfect tool for that task. Some
          marketers advocate analyzing <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1088"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1568"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1790"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2073"/>customer needs by the job the customer is trying to
          get done (known as the “jobs-be-done” approach) rather than by
          segments.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch29fn10" id="ch29fn10">145</a>]</sup></p><p>Get baselines from your clients that apply to their real-world
          businesses before you deploy. How many orders do they enter a day?
          How long does it take an employee to get payroll information? How
          many truck deliveries a day can their warehouse handle? What is the
          usual call hold time? Once you’ve deployed, use this information to
          measure progress, helping your advocates to prove the ROI—and
          turning it into case studies you can share with other
          customers.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Disentanglement"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="disentanglement">Disentanglement</h3></div></div></div><p>As you transition from a high-touch consulting business to a
          standardized one with less customer interaction, you need to focus
          on disentanglement. Your goal is to not have “anchor” customers that
          represent a disproportionate amount of your revenue or your support
          calls, because you need to scale.</p><p>Put your high-touch customers that you acquired early on into
          a segment and compare them to the rest of your customers. How do
          they differ? Do they consume a fair proportion of your support
          resources? Do their feature requests match those of all your
          customers and prospects? Don’t ignore the companies that made you
          who you are—but do realize they’re not in a monogamous relationship
          with you anymore.</p><p>Zach Nies suggests going even further, segmenting customers
          into three groups. “‘A customers’ are your really big customers who
          negotiated a big discount and expect the world from you. ‘B
          customers’ are customers who are fairly low maintenance, didn’t get
          a big discount, see themselves as partners with you, and provide
          useful insights. ‘C customers’ cause trouble, are a pain to deal
          with, and demand things from you that you feel will damage your
          business,” he explains. “Don’t spend too much time on the A’s—they
          sound good but aren’t the best for your business. Bring as many Bs
          on as customers as possible. And try to get your ‘C customers’ to be
          customers of your competitors.”</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Support Costs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="support_costs">Support Costs</h3></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1154"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1816"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1896"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2207"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2259"/>Zach’s advice is based on some fundamental truths. In
          many B2B-focused companies, the top 20% of customers generate
          150–300% of profits, while the middle 70% of customers break even,
          and the lowest 10% of customers reduce 50–200% of profits.<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.ch29fn11" id="ch29fn11">146</a>]</sup></p><p>You’ll track support metrics like top-requested features,
          number of outstanding trouble tickets, post-sales support, call
          center hold time, and so on. This will indicate where you’re losing
          money, and whether the product is standardized and stable enough to
          move into growth and scaling.</p><p>Segment this data, too. Figure out who’s costing the most
          money. Then consider firing them.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch29fn12" id="ch29fn12">147</a>]</sup> Once, it was hard to break out individual customer
          costs, but electronic systems make it possible to assign
          activities—such as support calls, emails, additional storage, or a
          truck roll—to individual customers.</p><p>You don’t actually have to fire customers, of course. You can
          simply change their pricing enough to make them profitable or
          encourage them to leave. This is part of getting your pricing right
          before you grow the business to a point where unprofitable clients
          can do real damage at scale.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="User Groups and Feedback"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="user_groups_and_feedback">User Groups and Feedback</h3></div></div></div><p>If your business involves big-ticket sales, you may have few
          enough customers that you can get many of them in the same room.
          Informal interaction with existing customers can be a boon to
          enterprise-focused startups, and resembles the problem and solution
          validation stages of the Lean Startup process—only rather than
          validating a solution, you’re validating a roadmap. Even with a
          large number of customers, Zach says, “Identify the real advocates
          and bring them in for a big hug.” He also suggests helping advocates
          network among themselves, which Rally does on its website.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch29fn13" id="ch29fn13">148</a>]</sup></p><p>Successful user-group meetings require considerable
          preparation. Users will be eager to please—or quick to complain—so
          results will be polarized. They’ll also agree to every feature you
          suggest. Force them to choose; they <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1181"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1669"/>can’t have everything, and you need to present them
          with hard alternatives (also known as <span class="emphasis"><em>discrete
          choices</em></span>).</p><p>A lot of work has gone into understanding how people make
          choices. “A ‘discrete’ choice,” says Berkeley professor Dan
          McFadden, “is a ‘yes/no’ decision, or a selection of one alternative
          from a set of possibilities.” His application of discrete choice
          modeling to estimate the adoption of San Francisco’s Bay Area Rapid
          Transit system—which was under construction at the time of his
          research—earned him the 2000 Nobel Prize in Economics.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch29fn14" id="ch29fn14">149</a>]</sup> One important conclusion from this work is that people
          find it easier to discard something they don’t want than to choose
          something they do (which feels like commitment), so a series of
          questions in which they are asked to discard one of two options
          works well.</p><p>The math of choice modeling is complex. There are entire
          conferences devoted to the subject, and it’s widely used in new
          product development for everything from laundry detergent to cars.
          But some of the methodologies are instructive. For example, you can
          get better answers by repeatedly asking your customers to compare
          two possible feature enhancements and choosing the one they can do
          without, rather than by simply asking them to rate the possible
          features on a scale of 1 to 10. You’ll do even better if you mix up
          several attributes in each comparison, regardless of whether a
          particular combination of attributes makes sense.</p><p>Imagine you’re trying to find a new diet food to introduce.
          You know the attributes that might affect buyers include taste,
          calories, gluten content, and sustainable ingredients. Simply asking
          prospects whether taste is more important to them than caloric
          content is informative. But asking them to make a choice between two
          discrete offerings—even if those offerings are theoretically
          impossible—is even better. Would you prefer:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>A delicious, gluten-free, high-calorie candy made with
              artificial ingredients;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Or a bland, high-gluten, low-calorie candy of organic
              origin?</p></li></ul></div><p>Asking customers to trade off variations of combinations, over
          and over, dramatically improves prediction accuracy. In fact, this
          is equivalent to the multivariate testing we’ve discussed before,
          applied to surveys and interviews.</p><p>As you’re designing user events, know what you’re hoping to
          learn and invest in the conversations and experimental design needed
          to get real answers that you can turn into the right product

          meetings in the early phases of your startup. It matters later on,
          when you’re about to bring on channels. Your channel partners aren’t
          as clever as you, and you’ll need to arm them with collateral and
          messaging that they can use to close deals without your assistance.
          If they try to push your product or service and encounter
          resistance, they’ll sell something else. With channels, you seldom
          get a second chance to make a first impression.</p><p>Create marketing tools for your channel and then test them
          yourselves. Make cold calls with their scripts. Pitch them to new
          customers. Send out email form letters and test response
          rates.</p><p>This does two things: first, it shows you which script, pitch,
          or form letter to use (because, after all, everything’s an
          experiment, right?, and second, it gives you a baseline against
          which to compare channel effectiveness. If a channel partner isn’t
          meeting your baseline, something else is wrong, and you can work to
          fix it before that partner sours on your product.</p><p>If you make channel collateral, tag each piece of collateral
          with something that identifies the channel. You might use shortened
          URLs that include a code identifying the partner in PDFs you create,
          which would let you see which partners’ efforts are driving traffic
          to your site.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Barriers to Exit"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="barriers_to_exit">Barriers to Exit</h3></div></div></div><p>As you bring customers on at scale, you want to make them
          stick around. A vibrant developer ecosystem and a healthy API allow
          customers to integrate themselves with you, making
          <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> the incumbent vendor and helping you to
          counter threats from competitors and new entrants.</p><p>Simon Wardley, who studies organizational warfare and
          evolution for the Leading Edge Forum, points out that companies must
          prioritize the long list of features customers need. Build too many,
          and they won’t all be profitable; build too few, and you leave the
          door open to competitors. APIs, he says, offer a solution.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch29fn15" id="ch29fn15">150</a>]</sup></p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>All innovations... are a gamble and whilst we can reduce
            costs we can never eliminate it. The future value of something is
            inversely proportional to the certainty we have over it; we cannot
            avoid this information barrier any more than we can reliably
            predict the future. However, there is a means to maximize our
            advantage.</p><p>By making these utility services accessible through APIs, we
            not only benefit ourselves but we can open up these components to
            a wider ecosystem. If we can encourage innovation in that wider
            ecosystem then we do not incur the cost of gambling [and] failure
            for those new activities. Unfortunately, we do not enjoy the
            rewards of their success either.</p><p>Fortunately, the ecosystem provides an early warning
            mechanism of success (i.e., adoption)...by creating a large enough
            ecosystem, we can not only encourage a rapid rate of innovation
            but also leverage that ecosystem to identify success and then
            either copy (a weak ecosystem approach) or acquire (a strong
            ecosystem approach) that activity. This is how we maximize our
            advantage.</p></blockquote></div><p>If you have an API, track its usage by clients. Those clients
          who have a lot of API activity are investing more in extending their
          relationship with you; those who are inactive could switch vendors
          more easily. If you have a developer program, examine searches and
          feature requests to discover what tools your customers want, then
          find developers to build features you aren’t going to create
          yourself.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="The Bottom Line: Startups Are Startups"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="bottom_line_startups_are_startups" style="clear: both">The Bottom Line: Startups Are Startups</h2></div></div></div><p>While enterprise-focused startups must contend with some
