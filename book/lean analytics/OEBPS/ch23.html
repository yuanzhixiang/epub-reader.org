        across many SaaS companies. But there’s one factor that produces a
        huge difference across many metrics: asking for payment up front
        during a trial.</p><p>Totango, a provider of SaaS customer intelligence and engagement
        software, has data across more than 100 SaaS companies, measuring
        trial, conversion, and churn rates. It has found that asking for a
        credit card during signup means 0.5% to 2% of visitors sign up for a
        trial, while <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> asking for a credit card means
        5% to 10% of visitors will enroll.</p><p>Enrollment isn’t the only goal, of course. You want users who
        enroll in a trial to become paying customers. Roughly 15% of trial
        users who did <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> provide a credit card will sign
        up for a paid subscription. On the other hand, 40–50% of trial users
        who <span class="emphasis"><em>did</em></span> provide one will convert to a paid
        subscription.</p><p>Asking for a credit card up front can also mean more churn after
        the first payment period if users’ expectations aren’t clearly set. Up
        to 40% of paid users may cancel their subscriptions—they forgot that
        they agreed to billing after the trial expired, and when they see a
        charge on their credit card, they cancel. Once this initial hurdle is
        over, however, most users stick <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1266"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1855"/>around each month. A 2009 Pacific Crest study found that
        best-in-class SaaS companies manage to get their annual churn rates
        below 15%.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch23fn01" id="ch23fn01">102</a>]</sup></p><p><a class="xref" href="ch23.html#impact_of_requiring_a_credit_card_to_try" title="Table 23-1. Impact of requiring a credit card to try a SaaS product">Table 23-1</a>

        people who try a SaaS product are just curious; others are seriously
        evaluating the tool. They show different behaviors, and can be treated
        as separate segments based on their activities and how much time they
        invest in exploring the product.</p><p>Let’s look at two basic funnels to see how both models work,
        focusing on Totango’s analysis of these “serious evaluators,” and
        using the higher values from <a class="xref" href="ch23.html#impact_of_requiring_a_credit_card_to_try" title="Table 23-1. Impact of requiring a credit card to try a SaaS product">Table 23-1</a>; see <a class="xref" href="ch23.html#two_engagement_and_churn_funnels" title="Table 23-2. Two engagement and churn funnels">Table 23-2</a>.</p><div class="table"><a id="two_engagement_and_churn_funnels"/><div class="table-title">Table 23-2. Two engagement and churn funnels</div><div class="table-contents"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col class="c1"/><col class="c2"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td colspan="2" style="vertical-align: top; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>5,000 serious

        front results in a total of 30 paying customers (from 5,000 visitors),
        whereas not doing so yields double the paying customers (60 in all). A
        paywall turns away evaluators who aren’t serious—but it also turns
        away people who are on the fence. Totango’s data shows that for most
        SaaS providers, 20% of visitors are serious evaluators, 20% are casual
        evaluators, and 60% are simply curious.</p><p>The best approach is to tailor marketing to users based on their
        activity. You need to convince serious evaluators that you’re the
        right choice, and convince the casual evaluators that they should
        become more serious. Identify serious prospects by usage analytics and
        focus sales resources on those users. Combining usage analytics
        (finding out who’s serious) with an open door (no paywall) yields the
        best results.</p><p>Let’s add a third funnel to the previous two—one where the SaaS
        provider is actively identifying and courting serious evaluators with
        tailored marketing. In this case, while everyone can try the tool,
        fewer subscribe, but those who do are more likely to remain (see <a class="xref" href="ch23.html#totangoapostrophes_data_on_a_third_funne" title="Table 23-3. Totango’s data on a third funnel for serious evaluators">Table 23-3</a>).</p><div class="table"><a id="totangoapostrophes_data_on_a_third_funne"/><div class="table-title">Table 23-3. Totango’s data on a third funnel for serious

        up a credit card paywall to try the service, but to segment users into
        three groups—then market to the active ones, nurture the casual ones,
        and don’t waste time on those who are just curious bystanders (or at
        best, get them to tell friends who might be real prospects about
        you).</p><div class="sect2" title="Bottom Line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="bottom_line-id00021">Bottom Line</h3></div></div></div><p>If you ask for a credit card up front, expect just 2% of

          buy—but if they’re surprised by a payment, you’ll lose them quickly.
          In our preceding example, not having a credit card up front gives
          you a 40% increase in conversions, provided you can tailor your
          selling efforts to each segment of your evaluators based on their

        particularly those based on software, is that of freemium versus paid
        models.</p><p>Proponents of a free model point out that adoption and attention
        are the most precious of currencies. Twitter waited until it had
        millions of active users before introducing advertising, and despite
        the outcry over promoted tweets, growth has continued. Chris Anderson,
        former editor-in-chief of <span class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> and author of
        <span class="emphasis"><em>The Long Tail</em></span> (Hyperion), observes that King
        Gillette pioneered the idea of giving something away (handles) to make
        money on something else (razor blades).<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch23fn02" id="ch23fn02">103</a>]</sup> But in many ways, online users have strong expectations
        that the Internet should be free, which means it’s hard to charge even
        for valuable things.</p><p>Detractors of freemium models observe that for every success
        like Dropbox or LinkedIn, there’s a deadpool of others who went out of
        business giving things away. In one example cited by the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></span>, billing-management software
        firm Chargify was on the brink of failure in 2010—but then it switched
        to a paid model, and in July 2012, became profitable with 900 paying
        customers.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch23fn03" id="ch23fn03">104</a>]</sup></p><p>Neil Davidson is concerned with the popularity of freemium,
        particularly among startups. “I think that for most people the
        freemium model is unsustainable,” he says. “It’s very hard to create
        something good enough that people will want to use, but with enough of
        a feature gap to the paid version so that people will upgrade.” Neil
        believes that too many startups charge too little, and undervalue
        themselves. “If you’re creating something that your customers value,
        then you shouldn’t shy away from asking them to pay for it. If you
        don’t, you haven’t got a business.”</p><p>Even when freemium works, users sometimes take a long time to
        start paying. Evernote’s Phil Libin talks about a “smile graph,” shown
        in <a class="xref" href="ch23.html#evernote_calls_this_a_smile_graphcomma_a" title="Figure 23-1. Evernote calls this a smile graph, and not just because of the shape">Figure 23-1</a>, that
        illustrates how customers who once abandoned the product eventually

        to a paid model after their first month, the number grows to 12% after
        two years. In fact, having been around long enough to collect a
        backlog of users who will eventually upgrade, the company experiences
        what David Skok calls <span class="emphasis"><em>negative</em></span> churn—which
        happens when product expansions, upselling, and cross-sells to your
        current customer base exceed the revenue that you are losing because
        of churn.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch23fn05" id="ch23fn05">106</a>]</sup> But many analysts consider Evernote an anomaly: unless
        you’re really good at the freemium approach, your free users can
        bankrupt you.</p><p>Jules Maltz and Daniel Barney of IVP, a late-stage venture
        capital and growth equity firm, suggest that freemium models work for
        products that have:<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch23fn06" id="ch23fn06">107</a>]</sup></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>A low cost of delivering service to an additional user

        O’Donnell of Price Intelligently points out that startups are trying
        to balance revenue optimization (making the most money possible) with
        unit sales maximization (encouraging wide adoption as the business
        grows) and value perception (not pricing so low you make buyers
        suspicious).<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.ch23fn07" id="ch23fn07">108</a>]</sup> Sellers also have to understand how to bundle several
        features or services into a package, and how to sell these bundles as
        tiers in order to reach several markets with different price
        points.</p><p>Even if you’re charging every customer, you can still experiment
        with pricing in the form of promotions, discounts, and time-limited
        offers. Each of these is a hypothesis suitable for testing across
        cohorts (if you use time-limited offers) or A/B comparisons (if you
        offer different pricing to different visitors).</p><p>Alex Mehr, the founder of online dating site Zoosk, understands
        the “optimal revenue” curve. But he argues that startups should err on
        the side of charging a bit too little.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch23fn08" id="ch23fn08">109</a>]</sup> “I prefer to make 10% less money but have 20% more
        customers. You want to stay a little bit to the left side of the peak.
        It is around 90% of the revenue maximization point.” Alex overlooks
        the issues of elasticity, value perception, and strategic discounting
        in his model, however.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Upselling and Growing Revenue"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="upselling_and_growing_revenue" style="clear: both">Upselling and Growing Revenue</h2></div></div></div><p>Best-in-class SaaS providers are able to grow revenues per

        spreads through the organization, as well as a series of tiered
        offerings and an easy upselling path. Done correctly, the increased
        revenues from upselling should nearly offset the 2% monthly losses

        that you need to get below a 5% monthly churn rate before you know
        you’ve got a business that’s ready to scale. Remember, though, if
        you’re surprising your subscribers in a bad way (e.g., billing them
        for something they didn’t know they’d ordered), then churn will spike
        during your first billing period, sometimes to 50%, so you should
        factor this into your calculations.</p><p>David Skok agrees with the 5% churn threshold, but only for
        early-stage companies, and says that you have to see a clear path to
        getting churn below 2% if you want to scale significantly:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>In the early days of a SaaS business, churn really doesn’t
          matter that much. Let’s say you lose 3% of your customers every
          month. When you only have a hundred customers, losing three of them
          is not that terrible. You can easily go and find another three to
          replace them. However, as your business grows in size, the problem
          becomes different. Imagine that you have become really big, and now
          have a million customers. Three percent churn means that you are
          losing 30,000 customers every month. That turns out to be a much
          harder number to replace.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="sect1 case_study" title="OfficeDrop’s Key Metric: Paid Churn"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_officedropapostrophes_key_met" style="clear: both">OfficeDrop’s Key Metric: Paid Churn</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1190"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1571"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1825"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2028"/>OfficeDrop helps small businesses manage paper and
        digital files in the cloud. Its service provides searchable cloud
        storage coupled with downloadable apps that allow businesses to sync,
        scan, search, and share files anywhere at any time. Currently, over
        180,000 users store data in the service, and its subscribers access
        and upload millions of files each month.</p><p>The company offers its solution as a freemium model with one
        free plan and three paid plans. We spoke with Healy Jones, Vice
        President of Marketing, to learn more about the company’s key metrics
        and lessons learned.</p><p>“Our most important number is paid churn,” says Healy.
        OfficeDrop defines paid churn as the number of paying users who
        downgrade to free or cancel divided by the total number of paying
        users available to churn at the beginning of the month.</p><p>For OfficeDrop, paid churn is a key indicator of the business’s
        overall health. “For example, we can tell how our marketing messaging
        is doing based on paid user churn—if a lot of new customers churn out,
        then we know our messaging doesn’t match what the customers are
        actually finding when they start using the product,” explains Healy.
        “We can also tell if our feature development is progressing in the
        direction that older users want: if they stick around for a long time
        then we are doing a good job, but if they churn out fast then we are
        not developing the product in the direction that they want. We can
        also tell if any bugs are causing people to be upset—if a lot of users
        cancel on a particular day, then we have to look and see if there was
        a technical problem that ticked people off.”</p><p>The company aims for a monthly churn rate below 4%. “Three
        percent is good,” Healy says. “Anything over 5% and we really don’t
        have a business that will generate gross margin positive growth.” Most
        recently, Healy says the company has been hitting a churn rate of 2%
        and hopes to maintain that.</p><p>As is often the case, churn is the inverse of engagement, and
        this is the second key metric for OfficeDrop. It defines an active
        user as someone who used the product in the previous month. When
        OfficeDrop launched, the founders assumed that people would not want
        to install programs on their computers or devices, that they would
        want a rich browser experience instead. “We did everything by our gut,
        and almost everything was wrong,” says Healy. “We hypothesized that
        the browser experience—which is the easiest to get started with and
        has the lowest barriers to entry for new customers—would be more
        likely to create engagement, but we didn’t start seeing real
        engagement, and in turn real customer growth and lower churn, until we
        built downloadable applications.”</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch23.html#can_you_tell_where_officedrop_added_a_mo" title="Figure 23-2. Can you tell where OfficeDrop added a mobile client app?">Figure 23-2</a>
        shows a classic hockey stick around June 2011. This measures the
        increased customer base (which is a result of increased engagement and
        reduced churn).</p><div class="figure"><a id="can_you_tell_where_officedrop_added_a_mo"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00060"/><img alt="Can you tell where OfficeDrop added a mobile client app?" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989327.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 23-2. Can you tell where OfficeDrop added a mobile client
          app?</div></div><p>“In mid-2011, we went mobile and first started offering
        OfficeDrop as a mobile app, and that had a huge impact,” says Healy.
        “A little harder to see—but equally important—was when we released our
        Mac desktop scanner application in January 2011. That was our first
        major downloadable app, and it got great press and drove even better
        engagement.”</p><p>After seeing that initial uptick in engagement, OfficeDrop made
        the commitment to develop mobile offerings. The company launched an
        Android app in May 2011, followed by an iPhone app in June 2011.
        “Going against our assumptions, we built a desktop application that
        proved successful. I think of that like a pivot for us, and it gave us
        the confidence to change our product offering. The results are clear:
        improved engagement and lower churn,” says Healy.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>OfficeDrop watches paid churn—paying customers who switch to

        Learned</strong></span></p><p>Always question your assumptions, even when you’re seeing
        traction. Customers want to use certain applications in certain
        ways—mapping on their mobile phone, for example. Doing a
        day-in-the-life analysis, or testing a major pivot with the
        introduction of a simple application, can often prove or invalidate a
        big assumption quickly, and change your fortunes forever.</p><p>Certain products or services are very sticky, in part because of
        the lock-in users experience. Photo upload sites and online backup
        services, for example, are hard to leave, because there’s a lot of
        data in place, so churn for those product categories may be lower. On
        the other hand, in an industry with relatively low switching costs,
        churn will be substantially higher.</p><p>Social sites may have some tricks at their disposal, too. If
        users try to leave Facebook, they’re reminded that some of their close
        friends will miss them—and they’ll lose pictures of those friends.
        This is an example of how an emotional tweak was later supported by
        the data: once implemented, this last-ditch guilt trip reduced
        deactivations by 7%, which at the time meant millions of users stayed
        on Facebook.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch23fn09" id="ch23fn09">110</a>]</sup></p><p>If you’re going to offer users an incentive to stick around—such
        as a free month or an upgrade to a new phone—you’ll have to weigh the
        cost of doing so against the cost of acquiring another customer. Of
        course, if word gets out that you’re incentivizing disgruntled users
        to stick around, then many customers may threaten to leave just to
        receive the discount, and getting the word out is what the Internet is
        for.</p><div class="sect2" title="Bottom Line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="bottom_line-id00024">Bottom Line</h3></div></div></div><p>Try to get down to 5% churn a month before looking at other
          things to optimize. If churn is higher than that, chances are you’re
          not sticky enough. If you can get churn to around 2%, you’re doing
          exceptionally well.</p></div></div><div class="footnotes" epub:type="footnotes"><br/><hr style="width: 100; align: left;"/><div class="footnote" id="ftn.ch23fn01"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#ch23fn01">102</a>] </sup><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.pacificcrest-news.com/saas/Pacific%20Crest%202011%20SaaS%20Workshop.pdf" target="_top">http://www.pacificcrest-news.com/saas/Pacific%20Crest%202011%20SaaS%20Workshop.pdf</a></em></span></p></div><div class="footnote" id="ftn.ch23fn02"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#ch23fn02">103</a>] </sup><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/16-03/ff_free" target="_top">http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/16-03/ff_free</a></em></span></p></div><div class="footnote" id="ftn.ch23fn03"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#ch23fn03">104</a>] </sup>Sarah E.
