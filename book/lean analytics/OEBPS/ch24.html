        tail” of popularity: a few apps do very well, but most of them
        flounder. According to Ken Seto, founder and CEO of mobile game
        company Massive Damage, “Some indie game developers get as few as a
        couple of downloads a day. This number is entirely dependent on your
        marketing, virality, and ranking in the app store.”</p><p>All businesses have competitors. But for mobile apps, the app
        store ecosystem puts that competition front and center. You can’t
        ignore your standings, and you can’t relax. “The tricky part,” he
        says, “is that it’s hard to stick at a certain ranking because
        everyone around you is trying to surpass you. So if your game doesn’t
        have natural hype—or isn’t promoted by Apple or paid marketing—you
        will slip in rankings. There’s no ‘typical’ here.”</p><div class="sect2" title="Bottom Line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="bottom_line-id00025">Bottom Line</h3></div></div></div><p>Expect yourself to be at the mercy of promotions, marketing,
          and the whims of the app store environment. The app store battle can
          be demoralizing, but smart mobile developers use the abundance of
          information about competitors to see what’s working, emulate their
          successes, and avoid their mistakes.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Mobile Download Size"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="mobile_download_size" style="clear: both">Mobile Download Size</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1145"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1433"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1740"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1869"/>As mobile applications get more complex, their file
        sizes increase. This poses a risk for developers, though; consumers on
        slower connections may abandon a download if it takes too long.
        Alexandre Pelletier-Normand, co-founder of Execution Labs, a game
        development accelerator, says, “If you want your app to be easily
        downloadable by anyone anywhere, it has to be under 50 megabytes, ‘on
        the portal’.”</p><p>An app that’s bigger than 50 MB for iOS devices will require a
        Wi-Fi connection. If a user doesn’t have a Wi-Fi connection, she won’t
        be able to download your app, and it’s unlikely she’ll bother trying
        again.</p><p>You can download apps that are larger than 50 MB on Android
        devices, but the process is greatly impacted by a warning from Google
        Play, which interrupts users and results in significant drop-off in
        the download process.</p><p>Alexandre makes a point of using the phrase “on the portal” to
        refer to the initial download from Apple’s App Store or Android app
        stores. He says, “Some developers will work around the limitation by
        having a small app on the Google or Apple portals, and this app will
        then download additional content ‘transparently’ from the developer’s
        servers while you play.”</p><div class="sect2" title="Bottom Line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="bottom_line-id00026">Bottom Line</h3></div></div></div><p>Keep your initial downloads small, and aim for less than 50 MB
          to minimize download churn.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Mobile Customer Acquisition Cost"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="mobile_customer_acquisition_cost" style="clear: both">Mobile Customer Acquisition Cost</h2></div></div></div><p>Some application developers use third-party marketing services
        to pay for installations. This is an ethical gray area for mobile
        developers: you’re using mercenaries to artificially inflate your
        download numbers and juice your ratings, in the hopes that the
        resulting improvement in rankings will convince real users to download
        the app. There are legitimate marketing services out there for mobile
        application and game developers, but be careful who you work with.
        While few of the people we’ve talked with will go on record about
        pricing, such services cost from $0.10 to $0.70 per install at the low
        end.</p><p>Because few of these installations become engaged players, it’s
        critical that you segment out mercenary installers to avoid polluting
        your other metrics. The metric you really care about is how many
        <span class="emphasis"><em>legitimate</em></span> users your mercenaries bring in, and
        how many of those become engaged, paying users.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1122"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1225"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1574"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1577"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1736"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2095"/>A more legitimate form of acquisition is banners or ads
        within other applications. Typically, these cost $1.50 to $4.00 per
        installation; these installations are more likely to become legitimate
        users because they found out about the application and chose to
        install it themselves. “The trick is to get your average cost per
        installation (across both mercenary and legitimate installations) to
        somewhere between $0.50 and $0.75,” says Ken Seto. “These numbers are
        all based on free games [with in-game monetization], however. I don’t
        think it’s cash-efficient to do paid installs for paid games.”</p><p>Keith Katz also warns against spending up to your CLV, which he
        sees a lot of app developers doing:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Too many mobile game developers seem to think the math works
          when you spend dollar for dollar against your customer lifetime
          value. But they tend to forget that you pay tax on your revenue to
          the government and then there’s the “platform tax” incurred by
          Apple’s App Store or Google Play, which is 30%. If you’re spending
          $1 to generate $1 in revenue, you’re really spending closer to $1 to
          generate $0.60.</p></blockquote></div><div class="sect2" title="Bottom Line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="bottom_line-id00027">Bottom Line</h3></div></div></div><p>Pay around $0.50 for a paid (mercenary) install, and around
          $2.50 for a legitimate, organic one, but make sure that your overall
          acquisition cost is less than $0.75 per user (and, of course, less
          than the lifetime value of a user). These costs are increasing, in
          part because large studios and publishers are getting more heavily
          into mobile and driving costs higher, and in part because of the
          crackdown on some marketing service tactics for delivering paid
          installs.</p></div></div><div class="sect1 case_study" title="Sincerely Learns the Challenges of Mobile Customer Acquisition"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_sincerely_learns_the_challeng" style="clear: both">Sincerely Learns the Challenges of Mobile Customer
        Acquisition</h2></div></div></div><p>Sincerely Inc. is the maker of the Sincerely gifting network and
        a number of mobile applications including Postagram, Ink Cards, and
        Sesame Gifts. The company’s first application, Postagram, lets people
        create and send a custom postcard from anywhere in the world. Ink
        Cards, its second app, allows you to send personalized greeting cards.
        And Sesame Gifts allows you to send themed gift sets in a beautiful
        box. The company has evolved from the simplest shippable item—a
        postcard—to $30–$50 gifts with Sesame.</p><p>When the company first started in 2010, co-founders Matt Brezina
        and Bryan Kennedy assumed that mobile ads would be like Google AdWords
        in 2000—early movers (to using mobile advertising) would have a huge
        advantage in a giant, not-yet-efficient user acquisition channel. “We
        figured by selling the simplest gift on the planet, a 99-cent
        postcard, we could easily buy users, get credit cards, and begin to
        make our gifting network profitable,” says Matt. “This strategy was
        gut instinct and some small experiments we ran on an off-branded app
        (i.e., one that wasn’t obviously affiliated with the Sincerely
        brand).”</p><p>It turns out Sincerely was able to buy users through mobile
        advertising for Postagram, but not cheaply enough. “Our metric for
        success was buying a Postagram user cheaply enough that they’d become
        profitable in under one year,” says Matt. “And if not, could we
        cross-promote them to another, more expensive gifting app to get them
        profitable within one year, and eventually three months.”</p><p>Matt and Bryan found that not only were mobile adds too
        expensive, but also that they were hard to track and the conversion
        rate from initial acquisition to mobile installation and launch was
        abysmal. So they launched Ink Cards six months after Postagram and set
        a price point starting at $1.99 per card. “Through cross-promotion, we
        increased the lifetime value of an initial Postagram user by around
        30%,” says Matt. “But the payback time <span class="emphasis"><em>still</em></span>
        wasn’t what we wanted it to be.”</p><p>Now Sincerely has launched Sesame, which offers gifts at a
        higher price point. “We now hope to get into the zone of sustainably
        growing the business through ads,” says Matt. But as a result of the
        cost and challenges with mobile advertising, Sincerely spends a
        significant amount of time focused on virality. “Through
        necessity—because the mobile ad equation just doesn’t work well
        enough—we’ve learned a lot about driving growth by enabling our users
        to share their great experience with new friends,” Matt says. “We do
        this by giving users free cards for people they’ve never sent any to.”
        This focus on viral growth reduces the reliance on advertising alone
        for user acquisition in a mobile industry where acquisition tools
        aren’t yet mature or efficient.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Sincerely launched Postagram to allow users to send 99-cent

            reduce their dependency on advertising channels.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Analytics Lessons
        Learned</strong></span></p><p>Mobile advertising is more complicated and more expensive than
        you may initially realize, and you need to track the customer
        acquisition cost carefully. You also need to track how quickly users
        pay back the cost of acquiring them, as well as their lifetime value.
        Test different channels and track user behavior, and use virality as a
        means of lowering your acquisition costs.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Application Launch Rate"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="application_launch_rate" style="clear: both">Application Launch Rate</h2></div></div></div><p>Simply downloading an application isn’t enough. Users have to
        launch it, and some wait a long time to do so. In addition to the size
        constraints outlined previously, multiple tablets and phones connected
        to a single account may download the application at different times,
        skewing your launch analytics. In other words: it’s
        complicated.</p><p>For free applications, many downloaders are just browsing
        applications casually and haven’t committed to a particular game or
        application and the related in-game purchases, so a higher percentage
        of downloads are never launched. For example, Massive Damage sees
        roughly 83% of downloads for its flagship game, <span class="emphasis"><em>Please Stay
        Calm</em></span>, lead to an application launch.</p><div class="sect2" title="Bottom Line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="bottom_line-id00028">Bottom Line</h3></div></div></div><p>Expect a significant number of downloads to never launch your

        There’s a gradual decline in active users over time, but the first day
        decline can be as high as 80%. Following that, there’s a gradual
        drop-off each day: for a cohort of users, as few as 5% of them may be
        around after a month.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1466"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1874"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2084"/>An October 2012 study by mobile analytics firm Flurry
        showed that across more than 200,000 applications, only 54% of users
        were still around at the end of the first month, only 43% were around
        at the end of the second, and only 35% were using the application by
        the end of the third.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch24fn01" id="ch24fn01">111</a>]</sup> On average, users interacted with the application 3.7
        times a day, though these metrics varied highly with the kind of
        application being used.</p><p>It’s important to note that overall engagement has increased in
        the numbers shared by Flurry (from 25% to 35% in the third month), but
        that frequency of use has dropped (from 6.7 uses a week to 3.7 a
        week). Flurry also notes that device affects engagement: smartphone
        users interact with an app 12.9 times a week, on average, but do so
        for only 4.1 minutes; tablet users interact with an app 9.5 times a
        week, but do so for 8.2 minutes.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch24fn02" id="ch24fn02">112</a>]</sup></p><div class="sect2" title="Bottom Line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="bottom_line-id00029">Bottom Line</h3></div></div></div><p>Assume that a big chunk of the people who try your app once
          will never do so again—but after that initial cliff drop, you’ll see
          a more gradual decline in engaged users. While the shape of this
          curve will vary by app, industry, and demographic, the curve always
          exists, so once you have a few data points you may be able to
          predict churn and disengagement ahead of time.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Percentage of Mobile Users Who Pay"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="percentage_of_mobile_users_who_pay" style="clear: both">Percentage of Mobile Users Who Pay</h2></div></div></div><p>If your application is paid-only, then this will naturally be
        “all of them,” but if you’re running a freemium model where users pay
        for enhanced functionality, then a good rule of thumb is that 2% of
        your users will actually sign up for the full offering.</p><p>For a free-to-play mobile game with in-app purchases, Ken Seto
        says that across the industry roughly 1.5% of players will buy
        something within the game during their use of it.</p><p>In-game purchases follow a typical power law, with a few
        “whales” spending significantly more on in-game activity and the
        majority spending little or nothing. A key factor in mobile
        application success is being able to strike a balance between gameplay
        quality (which increases good ratings and the number of players) and
        in-app purchases (which drives revenue). In a multiplayer game,
        maintaining game balance between paid and free players is a constant
        challenge.</p><div class="sect2" title="Bottom Line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="bottom_line-id00030">Bottom Line</h3></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1062"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1076"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1484"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1750"/>For a freemium model, aim for a conversion from free

          most users are just “fodder” for paying users. Early on in the
          user’s lifecycle, identify a leading indicator in her behavior—like
          time played per day, number of battles, or areas explored—that
          suggests whether she’s a non-payer, minnow, dolphin, or whale. Then
          provide different kinds of in-game monetization for these four
          segments—adapting your marketing, pricing, and promotions according
          to that behavior—selling bling to minnows, content to dolphins, and
          upgrades to whales (for example).</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Mobile App Ratings Click-Through"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="mobile_app_ratings_click-through" style="clear: both">Mobile App Ratings Click-Through</h2></div></div></div><p>Good ratings and reviews have a significant impact on downloads,
        but encouraging users to rate an app can be tough. After a few uses of
        the application, most developers pop up a message asking for a review;
        some developers even vary the message to try to encourage ratings. For
        example, one mobile developer asks questions like “Do you like this
        application?” or “Would you like to see more features and free
        content?” in the pop up; clicking “yes” takes the user to the ratings
        page.</p><p>Alexandre Pelletier-Normand warns that any message that offers
        something in exchange for a rating and isn’t neutral could get you
        blocked from an app store. But he also says, “You must proactively
        offer users the ability to rate your app at a strategic moment—ideally
        early in the game, since you want many ratings quickly—after a
        memorable gameplay sequence. Ratings are the most important factor
        considered in the ranking of the app.”</p><p>Review rates vary by app price and type. In one Quora response,
        a developer said expensive paid apps had a 1.6% review rate; cheap
        paid apps had a 0.5% review rate; and free trial apps had only a 0.07%
        review rate.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch24fn08" id="ch24fn08">118</a>]</sup> As that poster observed, sites like
        <span class="emphasis"><em>xyologic.com</em></span> have detailed data on download and
        ratings counts, so you can compare yourself to your particular
        segment. For free games, Massive Damage sees a 0.73% ratio of
        downloads to ratings.</p><div class="sect2" title="Bottom Line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="bottom_line-id00034">Bottom Line</h3></div></div></div><p>Expect less than 1.5% review rate for paid apps, and

        a customer, because it’s a function of spending, churn, engagement,
        and application design. But it’s a fundamental part of any business
        model, and it anchors other factors such as customer acquisition cost
        and cash flow.</p><p>GigaOm’s Ryan Kim observed<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch24fn09" id="ch24fn09">119</a>]</sup> that according to recent data,<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch24fn10" id="ch24fn10">120</a>]</sup> freemium apps (in which users pay for something within
        the application) have eclipsed premium apps (where the developer
        offers a second, paid version) in terms of revenue, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch24.html#premium_is_so_2010" title="Figure 24-1. Premium is so 2010">Figure 24-1</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="premium_is_so_2010"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00061"/><img alt="Premium is so 2010" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989328.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 24-1. Premium is so 2010</div></div><p>Customer loyalty is also linked to lifetime value, and loyalty
        depends heavily on the kind of application. Flurry has done extensive

        application types into two dimensions—how frequently an application is
        used, and what kind of user retention the application sees in a 90-day
        period—suggests different loyalty patterns.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch24fn11" id="ch24fn11">121</a>]</sup> These can in turn inform pricing strategies to maximize

            satisfy a need (such as buying a house, or completing the game)
            and then go away. A per-transaction fee on completion, as well as
            the right to reach out to the user when the need occurs again,
            will matter more than long-term engagement.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Infrequent, low-loyalty applications need to “grab money”

            of those infrequent interactions by upselling, encouraging the
