But if
      you’ve read through the past seven chapters, you’ll know that these
      numbers are rudimentary at best: you want churn below 2.5%; you want
      users to spend 17 minutes on your site if you’re in media or UGC; fewer
      than 2.5% of people will interact with content; 65% of your users will
      stop using your mobile app within 90 days. <span class="emphasis"><em>For many metrics,
      there’s simply no “normal.”</em></span></p><p>The reality is you’ll quickly adjust the line in the sand to your
      particular market or product. That’s fine. Just remember that you
      shouldn’t move the line to your ability; rather, you need to move your
      ability to the line.</p><p>Nearly any optimization effort has diminishing returns. Making a
      website load in 1 second instead of 10 is fairly easy; making it load in
      100 milliseconds instead of 1 second is much harder. Ten milliseconds is
      nearly impossible. Eventually, it’s not worth the effort, and that’s
      true of many attempts to improve something.</p><p>That shouldn’t be discouraging. It’s actually useful, because it
      means that as you approach a local maximum, you can plot your results
      over time and see an asymptote. In other words, the rate at which your
      efforts are producing diminishing results can suggest a baseline, and
      tell you it’s time to move to a different metric that matters.</p><p>Consider the 30-day optimization effort for a site that’s trying
      to convince visitors to enroll, shown in <a class="xref" href="ch28.html#can_you_see_the_gradual_improvement_in_t" title="Figure 28-1. Can you see the gradual improvement in this chart?">Figure 28-1</a>. At first, out of
      over 1,200 visitors, only 4 sign up—an abysmal 0.3% conversion rate. But
      each day, the company tweaks and tests enrollment even as site traffic
      grows modestly. By the end of the month, the site is converting 8.2% of
      its 1,462 visitors.</p><div class="figure"><a id="can_you_see_the_gradual_improvement_in_t"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00064"/><img alt="Can you see the gradual improvement in this chart?" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989331.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 28-1. Can you see the gradual improvement in this chart?</div></div><p>The question is: should this company keep working on enrollment,
      or has it hit diminishing returns? By applying a trend line to the
      conversion rate, we can quickly see the diminishing returns (<a class="xref" href="ch28.html#maybe_9percent_is_as_good_as_this_will_g" title="Figure 28-2. Maybe 9% is as good as this will get without a radical change">Figure 28-2</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="maybe_9percent_is_as_good_as_this_will_g"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00065"/><img alt="Maybe 9% is as good as this will get without a radical change" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989332.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 28-2. Maybe 9% is as good as this will get without a radical
        change</div></div><p>Ultimately, the best the company will be able to do with
      <span class="emphasis"><em>all else being equal</em></span> is achieve a conversion rate
      of around 9%. So on the one hand, that’s a good baseline, and gives a
      sense of the universe it’s in. On the other hand, all else is seldom
      equal. A new strategy for user acquisition could change things
      significantly.</p><p>This recalls our earlier discussion of local maxima. Iterating and
      improving the current situation will deliver diminishing returns, but
      that may be good enough to satisfy part of your business model and move
      forward. In this example, if the company’s business model assumes that
      7% of visitors will subscribe, then it’s time to move on to something
      else, such as increasing the number of visitors.</p><p>If you don’t have a good sense of what’s normal for the world, use
      this kind of approach. At least you’ll know what’s normal—and
      achievable—for your current business.</p><p>At this point, you’ve got an idea of your business model, the
      stage you’re at, and some of the baselines against which you should be
      comparing yourself. Now let’s move beyond startups into other areas
      where Lean Analytics still plays an important role: selling to the
      enterprise and intrapreneurs.</p></section></body></html>
