As you move beyond
      stickiness and virality, your metrics change. You’ll track new data and
      find a new OMTM as you funnel some of the money you collect back into
      acquiring new users. Customer lifetime value and customer acquisition
      cost drive your growth, and you’ll run experiments to try to capture
      more loyal users for less, tweaking how you charge, when you charge, and
      what you charge for. Welcome to the Revenue stage of Lean
      Analytics.</p><p>The goal in the Revenue stage is to turn your focus from
      <span class="emphasis"><em>proving your idea is right</em></span> to <span class="emphasis"><em>proving you
      can make money</em></span> in a scalable, consistent, self-sustaining
      way. Think of this as the piñata phase, where you beat on your business
      model in different ways until candy pours out.</p><p>Some startup advocates recommend charging for the product at the
      outset. This depends on several factors, from churn to cost of
      acquisition to the kind of application you’re building. But there’s a
      difference between <span class="emphasis"><em>charging up front</em></span> and
      <span class="emphasis"><em>focusing on revenue and margins</em></span>. In the earlier
      stages, it’s OK to run the business at a loss, or to give away accounts,
      or to issue refunds, or to let highly paid developers field support
      calls. Now, that has to change. Now, you’re not just building a
      product—you’re building a business.</p><div class="sect1" title="Metrics for the Revenue Stage"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="metrics_for_the_revenue_stage" style="clear: both">Metrics for the Revenue Stage</h2></div></div></div><p>Measuring revenue is easy enough, but remember that while raw
        revenue might be going “up and to the right,” revenue per customer is
        a better indicator of actual health. It’s a ratio, after all, and
        there’s a lot more you can learn from it. For example, if revenue is
        going up but revenue per <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1871"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2002"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2278"/>customer is going down, it tells you that you’re going
        to need a lot more customers to continue growing at the same pace. Is
        that doable? Does that make sense? The ratio helps you focus on making
        real decisions for your startup.</p><p>As a result, you’ll be looking at click-through rates and ad
        revenue, or conversion rate and shopping cart size, or subscriptions
        and customer lifetime value—or whatever brings in money. You’ll be
        comparing this to the cost of acquiring new users faster than they
        churn—because the net addition of visitors, users, and customers you
        can monetize is your growth rate.</p><p>You’ll also work hard at getting pricing right, balancing the
        highest price with the most paying customers. And you’ll be
        experimenting with bundles, subscription tiers, discounts, and other
        mechanisms to determine the best price.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The Penny Machine"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="penny_machine" style="clear: both">The Penny Machine</h2></div></div></div><p>An entrepreneur walks into a maple-paneled boardroom just off
        the 280, glances around the table at the well-groomed investors
        gathered there, and reaches into a large leather bag. She pulls out a
        strange machine, roughly two feet high by one foot wide, sets it
        carefully on the table, and plugs it in.</p><p>The room is expectantly quiet.</p><p>“Does anyone have a penny on them?” she asks. The general
        partner raises an eyebrow as one of the junior staff members hands
        over a faded copper piece.</p><p>“Now watch.”</p><p>The entrepreneur inserts the coin into the top of the machine
        and pulls a small lever. There is a low-pitched whirring, followed by
        a pause, and then a shiny new nickel tumbles into the small shelf at
        the bottom of the machine.</p><p>The only sound in the room is the ventilation system, cooling
        the warm Palo Alto air.</p><p>“That’s a neat trick,” says the silver-haired general partner,
        straightening up in his seat and grinding his brown Mephistos into the
        hypoallergenic rug beneath him. “Do it again.”</p><p>The staffer hands her another coin. She slides the second penny
        into the top of the machine, and again pulls the lever. Out slides
        another nickel.</p><p>“You’ve got a bag of nickels in there,” accuses a slightly
        disheveled technical analyst, somewhat defensively. “Open it
        up.”</p><p>Wordlessly, the entrepreneur releases a small clasp on the side
        of the machine and swings it open. Within are a series of tubes and
        wires, but nowhere is big enough to conceal nickels. The analyst looks
        mildly offended, but the general partner is on the edge of his seat as
        she closes the machine back up.</p><p>“How many pennies can I put in there per hour?” he asks.</p><p>“It takes five seconds to cool down, so you can insert 720
        pennies an hour. That’s $36 in nickels for a profit of $28.80 an hour,
        with a margin of 80%.”</p><p>The general partner leans back in his Aeron chair and gazes out
        across the highway, into the Woodside hills. He pauses for a minute.
        “Can I put nickels into it?” he inquires.</p><p>“I’ve tried it with dimes. It works. Produces neatly folded
        dollar bills. I haven’t tried anything more than that yet, but I’m
        hoping it will handle fives,” replies the entrepreneur.</p><p>“How many can you make and run at once?” asks the partner,
        oblivious to the rest of the room.</p><p>“I think we can have 500 machines running around the clock. They
        cost $30,000 apiece and take two months to make.”</p><p>“One more question,” says the partner, “and I think we have a
        deal. Why can’t someone else build one?”</p><p>“I have intellectual property protection on the core mechanism,
        and I’ve signed an exclusive agreement with the US Mint to be the only
        producer of legal currency.”</p><p>Of course, this isn’t a real venture capital pitch. But it’s as
        close to perfect as one can get. We can learn a lot from the penny
        machine, and it’s a great metaphor to get startup CEOs thinking like
        investors.</p><p>The penny machine has an obvious money-making ability: you put
        in money, and more comes out. People understand what a penny is. While
        no business is as clear-cut as the penny machine, every CEO needs to
        make his business model as straightforward as possible, particularly
        to outsiders, so it’s painfully obvious why the venture will yield
        revenues.</p><p>The entrepreneur had reasonable answers to key questions: how
        big can the business grow, how good can the margins get, and what
        kinds of barriers to entry does it have?</p><p>The presenter engaged the audience, and let them help her tell
        the story. They were smart people who asked the questions she wanted,
        and she showed them that she’d anticipated their questions by
        providing slightly more detail than they asked for without going into
        too much depth.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1566"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1938"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1954"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2029"/>There was no need for a detailed technical explanation
        at this stage. Later, the investors would certainly go over the
        technology carefully to ensure that it wasn’t illegal, immoral, or
        outright trickery. But this meeting wasn’t about that. Opening the
        machine up served as a simple proof that everyone in the room
        understood well enough.</p><p>The entrepreneur didn’t set a valuation. She gave the investors
        all the details they needed to form one of their own, based on revenue
        potential, margin, costs, and so on. They could also calculate the
        working capital needed to fund the creation of the machines, based on
        cost and time, as well as return on investment.</p><p>Startup CEOs seeking venture capital would do well to remember
        the penny machine. It’s a good way to ensure you’re thinking like a
        venture capitalist. Every time your pitch strays from the simplicity
        of this meeting, it’s a warning sign that you need to go back and
        tighten it up.</p><div class="sect2" title="Penny Machines and Magic Numbers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="penny_machines_and_magic_numbers">Penny Machines and Magic Numbers</h3></div></div></div><p>This isn’t just an entertaining metaphor for entrepreneurs
          preparing to pitch. Think of your company as a machine that
          predictably generates more money than you put into it. Measuring the
          ratio of inputs to outputs tells you whether you have a good machine
          or a broken one.</p><p>In 2008, Ominture’s Josh James suggested one way to understand
          how a SaaS company is doing, and to decide whether it’s time to step
          on the gas or to reconsider the business model.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch18fn01" id="ch18fn01">69</a>]</sup> It’s pretty simple, really: look at the return on
          investment of your marketing dollar. In a SaaS company, you spend
          money on sales and marketing in the hopes that you’ll sign up new
          customers. If all goes well, the following quarter your revenues
          will have increased.</p><p>To measure the health of the machine, divide how much you
          changed the annual recurring revenue in the past quarter by what it
          cost you to do so. You need three numbers to do this
          calculation:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Your quarterly recurring revenue for quarter
              <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> (QRR[<span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>])</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Your quarterly recurring revenue for the quarter before
              <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> (QRR[<span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> – 1])</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Your sales and marketing expense for the quarter before
              <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> (QExpSM[<span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> –
              1])</p></li></ul></div><p>If you don’t have quarterly sales and marketing spending, you
          can take the annual spending and divide it by four. This also helps
          smooth out spikes <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1654"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1996"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2171"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2282"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2357"/>in marketing spend or seasonal shifts, since not all
          the sales you get this quarter are a result of last quarter’s sales
          efforts—some may have benefitted from previous quarters.</p><p>The formula looks like this:</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00051a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00051"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989318.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>If the result is below 0.75, you have a problem. When you pump
          money into the machine, less money comes out. That’s a bad thing for
          this stage of your business, because it means there’s a fundamental
          flaw in your business model. If the result is better than 1, you’re
          doing well—you can fund your growth with the proceeds, funneling
          revenue increases back into the machine to increase sales and
          marketing spend.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Finding Your Revenue Groove"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="finding_your_revenue_groove" style="clear: both">Finding Your Revenue Groove</h2></div></div></div><p>At this stage in your startup, you’ve got a product that users
        like and tell other users about. You’re trying to figure out the best
        way to monetize the product. Recall Sergio Zyman’s definition of
        marketing (<span class="emphasis"><em>more stuff to more people for more money more
        often more efficiently</em></span>) using. In the Revenue stage, you
        need to figure out which “more” increases your revenues per engaged
        customer the most:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>If you’re dependent on physical, per-transaction costs (like
            direct sales, shipping products to a buyer, or signing up
            merchants), then <span class="emphasis"><em>more efficiently</em></span> will figure
            prominently on either the supply or demand side of your business
            model.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you’ve found a high viral coefficient, then
            <span class="emphasis"><em>more people</em></span> makes sense, because you’ve got a
            strong force multiplier added to every dollar you pour into
            customer acquisition.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you’ve got a loyal, returning set of customers who buy
            from you every time, then <span class="emphasis"><em>more often</em></span> makes
            sense, and you’re going to emphasize getting them to come back
            more frequently.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you’ve got a one-time, big-ticket transaction, then
            <span class="emphasis"><em>more money</em></span> will help a lot, because you’ve
            got only one chance to extract revenue from the customer and need
            to leave as little money as possible on the table.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you’re a subscription model, and you’re fighting churn,
            then upselling customers to higher-capacity packages with broader
            features is your best way of growing existing revenues, so you’ll
            spend a lot of time on <span class="emphasis"><em>more stuff</em></span>.</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2" title="Where Does the Money Come From?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="where_does_the_money_come_fromquestion_m">Where Does the Money Come From?</h3></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1148"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1230"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1478"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1569"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2106"/>For many services that charge a recurring fee, you
          need to decide if you’re charging everyone, or just premium users. A
          freemium model may work, but it’s not always a good
          thing—particularly if free users cost you money, and if you can’t
          naturally distinguish the paid version of your service with tiers
          that a regular user will naturally encounter, such as number of
          projects or gigabytes of storage.</p><p>One variant on freemium is pay-for-privacy, where the content
          your users create is available to everyone unless they explicitly
          pay to keep it to themselves. SlideShare uses a variant of this.
          While the site does make money from advertising, it also charges
          users for a premium model where the content they upload isn’t
          available to everyone. Now that they’re part of LinkedIn, they’re
          also subsidized by that company’s business model.</p><p>If your users all pay, then you need to decide if you’ll have
          trial periods, discounts, or other incentives. Ultimately, the best
          revenue strategy is to make a great product: the best startups have
          what Steve Jobs referred to as the “insanely great,” with customers
          eager to give them money for what they see as true value.</p><p>If none of your users pay, then you’re relying on advertising,
          or other behind-the-scenes subsidies, to pay the bills.</p><p>Many startups blend several of the six business models we’ve
          seen to form their own unique revenue model. They then find ways to
          pour that revenue into their own mix of virality and customer
          acquisition, investing some amount of their income into
          growth.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Customer Lifetime Value &gt; Customer Acquisition Cost"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="customer_lifetime_value_greater_than_cus" style="clear: both">Customer Lifetime Value &gt; Customer Acquisition Cost</h2></div></div></div><p>When it comes to turning revenues into additional customers, the
        most basic rule is simple: spend less money acquiring customers than
        you get from them.</p><p>That’s hugely oversimplified, because you really want to spend
        only a fraction of your revenue on acquisition if you’re going to keep
        the lights on, hire in anticipation of growth, spend money on
        research, and generate a return on investment.</p><p>The CLV-CAC math also needs to reflect the fact that there’s a
        delay between paying to acquire customers and those customers paying
        you back. Any investment or loans you take aren’t just paying for you
        to get to breakeven, they’re also paying for the anticipated revenue
        from customers.</p><p>Balancing acquisition, revenue, and cash flow is at the core of
        running many business models, particularly those that rely on
        subscription revenue <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1300"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1326"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1862"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1887"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2001"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2174"/>and paying to gain customers. As you play with the
        numbers to strike that balance, there are really four variables you
        work on:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The money in the bank at the outset (i.e., your
            investment)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The amount of money spent on customer acquisition each
            month</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The revenue you bring in from users</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The rate of churn from users</p></li></ul></div><p>Get the math right. Take too much, and you dilute your
        ownership; take too little, and you run out of cash simply because
        your users pay you over time but you have to acquire them up
        front.</p></div><div class="sect1 case_study" title="Parse.ly and the Pivot to Revenue"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_parsedotly_and_the_pivot_to_r" style="clear: both">Parse.ly and the Pivot to Revenue</h2></div></div></div><p>Parse.ly makes an analytics tool that helps the Web’s big
        publishers understand what content is driving traffic. It was first
        launched in 2009 out of Philadelphia’s Dreamit Ventures as a reader
        tool for consumers to find stories they’d like. A year later, the
        company changed its approach: since it knew what a reader might like
        to read next, it could help publishers suggest content that would keep
        readers on the site for longer. And in 2011, it changed again, this
        time offering reporting tools to publishers who wanted to know what
        was working. The current product, Parse.ly Dash, is an analytics tool
        for publishers.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch18fn02" id="ch18fn02">70</a>]</sup></p><p>While Dash is a successful product today, the company had to
        abandon its earlier work in its search for a sustainable business
        model. “It was very hard for us to shift away from our consumer
        newsreader product. That’s because all the metrics were actually quite
        positive,” says Mike Sukmanowsky, Parse.ly’s Product Lead.</p><p>“We had thousands of users and the product was growing rapidly.
        We were written up in top technology press like TechCrunch,
        ReadWriteWeb, and ZDNet. The product worked and we had a million ideas
        for how to improve it even further. However, it was lacking one
        critical metric for any growing business—revenue. We ran tests and
        surveys, and learned that though our users loved Parse.ly Reader, they
        didn’t love it so much that they’d be willing to pay for it.”</p><p>The founders had plenty of code, but no revenue, and costs were
        growing. Mike attributes part of this to the focus that startup
        accelerators have on rapid prototyping, often at the expense of
        customer development. “One of the challenges of an accelerator is that
        they are so product-focused (ship it quick) and pressure-oriented (two
        months to demo) that a lot of our customer development had to happen
        parallel to product development. And, in fact, some of the biggest
        questions were answered after shipping our first version.”<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch18fn03" id="ch18fn03">71</a>]</sup></p><p>Once the company had decided to change business models, it
        stopped development on the reader entirely. While the new offering was
        built from scratch, it leveraged much of the technology and many of
        the architectural lessons learned from the first product. Now a direct
        sales team sells its current offering, using a trial period for
        evaluation, and then charging a monthly fee.</p><p>As you might expect from an analytics firm, the Parse.ly team
        collects and analyzes a lot of data. In addition to using Dash
        themselves, they rely on Woopra for engagement and to arm their sales
        team, Graphite for tracking time-series data, and Pingdom for uptime
        and availability.</p><p>As the company iterated through various business models, the
        metrics it tracked changed accordingly.</p><p>“For Parse.ly Reader, our core metrics were new signups and user
        engagement. We would pay close attention to how many signups per day
        we were getting based on our press write-ups and how many logins per
        day we were getting from user accounts,” says Mike. “In the Parse.ly
        Publisher Platform, we focused entirely on number of recommendation
        impressions served, and click-through rate of our recommendations. We
        still pay close attention to these metrics for users of our
        API.”</p><p>For the current reporting product, the company tracks a broader
        set of metrics, including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>New signups per day for trial accounts</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Conversion rate on the signup flow and account activation
            process</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Number of active users (seats) per account and account
            invitation activity</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>User engagement (based on Woopra data)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>API calls in Graphite</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Website activity in Google Analytics</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Tracked page views and unique visitors across all the sites
            running within the network of monitored sites</p></li></ul></div><p>Since its software is installed on a number of sites, it also
        tracks data for those sites, including the average number of posts
        published, average page views, and top referrers. And it tracks
        fundamental business metrics—head count, customer count, server count,
        revenue, costs, and profit.</p><p>In the end, <span class="emphasis"><em>Parse.ly</em></span> had to make some
        painful decisions despite the apparent success of a consumer business.
        It didn’t test the monetization of its initial product, even though
        that was one of the riskiest aspects. But when, before its second
        pivot, it spent time talking to its enterprise customers about the
        dashboard, the answer was clear: “We’d show them proof of concepts of
        the analytics tool we could deliver to them, and they began to clamor
        for the insights we were proposing,” recalls Mike. “They cared more
        about the prospect of this tool than the recommendations we were
        providing.”</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Even if you have healthy growth in an important dimension

            convert it to money and pay the bills.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Pivoting the business changed the OMTM immediately.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Every company lives in an ecosystem—in this case, of
            readers, publishers, and advertisers. It’s often easier to pivot
            to a new market than to create an entirely new product, and, once
            you’ve done so, for the market to help you realize what product
            you should have made in the first place.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Analytics Lessons
        Learned</strong></span></p><p>Recognize that being able to make money is an inherent
        assumption of most business models, but that to de-risk the model you
        need to test it early. Be prepared to radically change, or even shut
        down, parts of your company in your quest for revenue.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Market/Product Fit"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="marketsolidusproduct_fit" style="clear: both">Market/Product Fit</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1888"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1999"/>Most people’s first instinct when things aren’t going
        incredibly well is to build more features. Hopefully we’ve
        demonstrated that this isn’t the right approach, because the
        likelihood that any one feature is going to suddenly solve your
        customers’ problems is very small.</p><p>Instead, try pivoting into a new market. The assumption here is
        that the product isn’t the problem, it’s the target customer. In a
        perfect world, you’ve validated the market before building anything,
        but mistakes happen, and in some cases you’re not starting at step one
        of the customer development process and don’t want to throw away
        everything you’ve built. It may be easier to change markets than
        products.</p><p>Many startup founders discover Lean Startup at a specific point
        in their growth: they’ve built a product and it has a bit of traction,
        but not enough to be exciting. They’re facing a difficult decision.
        Should they continue on the current path or change something? They’re
        looking for answers. They’re searching for ways to build more traction
        and they’re not ready to give up. This is common for bigger companies
        and intrapreneurs as well: they have something in the market, but it’s
        not at the scale they want and they’re looking for ways to increase
        growth rate or market share.</p><p>Instead of building new features or rebuilding from scratch, try
        pointing your product at a new market. We think of this as
        <span class="emphasis"><em>market/product fit</em></span> instead of
        <span class="emphasis"><em>product/market fit</em></span>, because you’re trying to find
        a market that fits your existing product. This also applies to
        changing your business model, which is a completely reasonable
        approach to finding scale. Again, it’s market/product fit because
        you’re changing a market variable (the business model) and keeping the
        product static (or relatively so).</p><p>Here are some suggestions for taking an existing product and
        finding a new market.</p><div class="sect2" title="Review Your Old Assumptions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="review_your_old_assumptions">Review Your Old Assumptions</h3></div></div></div><p>Look back at the old assumptions you had about the markets you
          were going after with the product. If you didn’t have any
          assumptions around why a particular market would work, now is the
          time to do a postmortem on that and use the benefit of hindsight.
          Why didn’t it work? What’s holding back traction in the market? Are
          the pain points you’re solving genuinely painful enough to the
          markets you were going after?</p><p>Now look at markets related to those you tackled previously.
          What do you know about these markets? What makes these markets
          similar or different from the ones you went after?</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1761"/>Going out and doing problem interviews in new markets
          will help you figure out if your product is going to solve painful
          enough problems. You should be able to compare what you hear from
          new markets with the hindsight analysis you have of your existing
          customer base.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Begin a Process of Elimination"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="begin_a_process_of_elimination">Begin a Process of Elimination</h3></div></div></div><p>You’ll be able to drop some markets and/or business models
          pretty quickly. For example, a freemium model requires a huge base
          of prospective customers. Lincoln Murphy does a great job of laying
          out the math on addressable market size in a presentation entitled
          <span class="emphasis"><em>The Reality of Freemium in SaaS</em></span>.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch18fn04" id="ch18fn04">72</a>]</sup> One of his big conclusions: without a huge potential
          market and a number of other factors, freemium just doesn’t
          work.</p><p>Understanding the mechanics of various markets and business
          models helps you triangulate the combinations that work best.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Deep Dive"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="deep_dive">Deep Dive</h3></div></div></div><p>When you’ve identified potential new markets and a prospective
          business model, it’s time to do a deep dive and get into the full
          swing of customer development. Speak with 10–15 prospects in each
          market to validate your assumptions around their problems. This may
          feel like a slow process—after all, you have a product ready to
          sell—but the effort will be worthwhile, because you’ll avoid going
          into markets that aren’t a good fit.</p><p>In parallel, you can also take a broader approach and look to
          reach customers at scale, using landing pages and advertising to
          gauge interest. But don’t skip steps and ignore the problem
          interviews completely.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Find Similarities"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="find_similarities">Find Similarities</h3></div></div></div><p>When looking at a market at this stage, you need to narrow it
          down and go niche. Using “size of company” as your metric for market
          definition isn’t good enough. We see this all the time, but SMBs
          (small and medium businesses) are not a market; the category’s just
          too broad.</p><p>Look for important similarities between companies inside of a
          broadly defined market. Industry is a good place to start. But also
          consider geography, how they purchase products, what they’ve
          recently purchased, budgets, industry growth, seasonality,
          legislative constraints, and decision makers. All of these factors
          help define a true market you can go after quickly.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1120"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1771"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2275"/>Pitch the product you have, but don’t feel obligated
          to pitch it exactly as it works today. Simultaneous with your
          efforts to find the right market and business model, you need to
          envision how the product will change and be repackaged. This isn’t a
          complete rebuild that will take huge amounts of effort, but there’s
          no reason you can’t pitch a modified version of your existing
          product based on what you’ve learned about your new target
          market.</p><p>Essentially, your existing product is the MVP, and hopefully
          it suffices as the MVP and doesn’t require major change. A few nips
          and tucks are all that’s needed—and suddenly customers are thrilled
          with the speed with which you’ve delivered the product.</p><p>Finding a new market for an existing product is difficult. And
          the reality is that there may not be a market for the product you
          have, and you’ll be moving into a much more substantial pivot or a
          complete redo. But before you get to that stage, stop, pull back,
          and look for a customer base that will pay you for what you already
          have. To succeed at this, you need to remain committed to the Lean
          Startup process and customer development, but you can start part-way
          through the process instead of going completely back to square
          one.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="The Breakeven Lines in the Sand"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="breakeven_lines_in_the_sand" style="clear: both">The Breakeven Lines in the Sand</h2></div></div></div><p>Revenue is not the only financial metric that matters. You want
        to be <span class="emphasis"><em>breakeven</em></span>—meaning your revenues exceed your
        costs on a regular basis. Driving toward profitability may not be the
        right thing to do—you may be focused on another metric, such as user
        acquisition. But it’s irresponsible not to think about breakeven,
        because if there’s no way you can ever get there, you’re just burning
        money and time.</p><p>This means looking at business metrics such as operating costs,
        marginal costs, and so on. You may discover that it’s a good idea to
        fire a segment of your customers because of the drain they represent
        on the business—this is particularly true in B2B startups. With that
        in mind, here are some possible “gates” you may want to use to decide
        if you’re ready to move to the Scale stage.</p><div class="sect2" title="Breakeven on Variable Costs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="breakeven_on_variable_costs">Breakeven on Variable Costs</h3></div></div></div><p>As a startup, you’re probably spending more on growth than
          you’re making on revenue, particularly if you’ve taken funding and
          aren’t bootstrapping the business from your own resources. Your
          investors don’t want to own part of a breakeven company—they want
          shares that pay back multiples on a lucrative acquisition or
          IPO.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1117"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1118"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1119"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1149"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1231"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1335"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1523"/>If the money you make from a customer exceeds the cost
          of acquiring that customer and delivering the service, you’re doing
          well. You may be pouring money into new features, recruiting, and so
          on—but each customer isn’t costing you anything.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Time to Customer Breakeven"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="time_to_customer_breakeven">Time to Customer Breakeven</h3></div></div></div><p>A key measurement of successful revenue growth is whether the

          depreciation, and amortization—is an accounting term that fell out
          of favor when the dot-com bubble burst. Many companies used this
          model because it let them ignore their large capital investments and
          crushing debt. But in today’s startup world, where up-front capital
          expenses have been replaced by pay-as-you-go costs like cloud
          computing, EBITDA is an acceptable way to consider how well you’re

          If you reduced the company to its minimum—keeping the lights on,
          servicing existing customers, but doing little else—could you
          survive? This is often referred to as “ramen profitability.” There’s
          no new marketing spend. Your only growth would come from word of
          mouth or virality, and customers wouldn’t get new features. But it’s
          a breakeven point at which you’re “master of <a class="indexterm" id="iddle2003"/>your own destiny” because you can survive
          indefinitely. For some startups, particularly self-funded ones, this
          may be a good model to use because it gives you a much stronger
          negotiating position if you’re seeking financing.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Revenue Stage Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="revenue_stage_summary" style="clear: both">Revenue Stage Summary</h2></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The core equation for the Revenue stage is the money a
