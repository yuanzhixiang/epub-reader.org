Entrepreneurs are the
      most delusional of all.</p><p>Entrepreneurs are particularly good at lying to themselves. Lying
      may even be a prerequisite for succeeding as an entrepreneur—after all,
      you need to convince others that something is true in the absence of
      good, hard evidence. You need believers to take a leap of faith with
      you. As an entrepreneur, you need to live in a semi-delusional state
      just to survive the inevitable rollercoaster ride of running your
      startup.</p><p>Small lies are essential. They create your reality distortion
      field. They are a necessary part of being an entrepreneur. But if you
      start believing your own hype, you won’t survive. You’ll go too far into
      the bubble you’ve created, and you won’t come out until you hit the
      wall—hard—and that bubble bursts.</p><p>You need to lie to yourself, but not to the point where you’re
      jeopardizing your business.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>That’s where data comes in</em></span>.</p><p>Your delusions, no matter how convincing, will wither under the
      harsh light of data. Analytics is the necessary counterweight to lying,
      the yin to the yang of hyperbole. Moreover, data-driven learning is the
      cornerstone of success in startups. It’s how you learn what’s working
      and iterate toward the right product and market before the money runs
      out.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1330"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1614"/>We’re not suggesting that gut instinct is a bad thing.
      Instincts are inspiration, and you’ll need to listen to your gut and
      rely on it throughout the startup journey. But don’t disembowel
      yourself. Guts matter; you’ve just got to test them. <span class="emphasis"><em>Instincts
      are experiments</em></span>. <span class="emphasis"><em>Data is proof</em></span>.</p><div class="sect1" title="The Lean Startup Movement"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="lean_startup_movement" style="clear: both">The Lean Startup Movement</h2></div></div></div><p>Innovation is hard work—harder than most people realize. This is
        true whether you’re a lone startup trying to disrupt an industry or a
        rogue employee challenging the status quo, tilting at corporate
        windmills and steering around bureaucratic roadblocks. We get it.
        Entrepreneurship is crazy, bordering on absurd.</p><p>Lean Startup provides a framework by which you can more
        rigorously go about the business of creating something new. Lean
        Startup delivers a heavy dose of intellectual honesty. Follow the Lean
        model, and it becomes increasingly hard to lie, especially to
        yourself.</p><p>There’s a reason the Lean Startup movement has taken off now.
        We’re in the midst of a fundamental shift in how companies are built.
        It’s vanishingly cheap to create the first version of something.
        Clouds are free. Social media is free. Competitive research is free.
        Even billing and transactions are free.<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.ch01fn01" id="ch01fn01">3</a>]</sup> We live in a digital world, and the bits don’t cost
        anything.</p><p>That means you can build something, measure its effect, and
        learn from it to build something better the next time. You can iterate
        quickly, deciding early on if you should double down on your idea or
        fold and move on to the next one. And that’s where analytics comes in.
        Learning doesn’t happen accidentally. It’s an integral part of the
        Lean process.</p><p>Management guru and author Peter Drucker famously observed, “If
        you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.”<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.ch01fn03" id="ch01fn03">4</a>]</sup> Nowhere is this truer than in the Lean model, where
        successful entrepreneurs build the product, the go-to-market strategy,
        and the systems by which to learn what customers
        want—simultaneously.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Poking a Hole in Your Reality Distortion Field"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="poking_a_hole_in_your_reality_distortion" style="clear: both">Poking a Hole in Your Reality Distortion Field</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1037"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1241"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2352"/>Most entrepreneurs have been crushed, usually more than
        once. If you haven’t been solidly trounced on a regular basis, you’re
        probably doing it wrong, and aren’t taking the risks you need to
        succeed in a big way.</p><p>But there’s a moment on the startup rollercoaster where the
        whole thing comes right off the rails. It’s truly failed. There’s
        little more to do than turn off the website and close down the bank
        account. You’re overwhelmed, the challenges are too great, and it’s
        over. You’ve failed.</p><p>Long before the actual derailment, you knew this was going to
        happen. It wasn’t working. But at the time, your reality distortion
        field was strong enough to keep you going on faith and fumes alone. As
        a result, you hit the wall at a million miles an hour, lying to
        yourself the whole time.</p><p>We’re not arguing against the importance of the reality
        distortion field—but we do want to poke a few holes in it. Hopefully,
        as a result, you’ll see the derailment in time to avoid it. We want
        you to rely less on your reality distortion field, and rely more on
        Lean Analytics.</p></div><div class="sect1 case_study" title="Airbnb Photography—Growth Within Growth"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_airbnb_photographyem_dashgrow" style="clear: both">Airbnb Photography—Growth Within Growth</h2></div></div></div><p>Airbnb is an incredible success story. In just a few years, the
        company has become a powerhouse in the travel industry, providing
        travelers with an alternative to hotels, and providing individuals who
        have rooms, apartments, or homes to rent with a new source of income.
        In 2012, travelers booked over 5 million nights with Airbnb’s service.
        But it started small, and its founders—adherents to the Lean Startup
        mindset—took a very methodical approach to their success.</p><p>At SXSW 2012, Joe Zadeh, Product Lead at Airbnb, shared part of
        the company’s amazing story. He focused on one aspect of its business:
        <span class="emphasis"><em>professional photography</em></span>.</p><p>It started with a hypothesis: “Hosts with professional
        photography will get more business. And hosts will sign up for
        professional photography as a service.” This is where the founders’
        gut instincts came in: they had a sense that professional photography
        would help their business. But rather than implementing it outright,
        they built a <span class="emphasis"><em>Concierge Minimum Viable Product</em></span>
        (MVP) to quickly test their hypothesis.</p><div class="note" title="What Is a Concierge MVP?"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01note01"/>What Is a Concierge MVP?</h3><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1722"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1762"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1764"/>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Minimum Viable Product</em></span> is the
          smallest thing you can build that will create the value you’ve
          promised to your market. But nowhere in that definition does it say
          how much of that offering has to be real. If you’re considering
          building a ride-sharing service, for example, you can try to connect
          drivers and passengers the old-fashioned way: by hand.</p><p>This is a concierge approach. It recognizes that sometimes,
          building a product—even a minimal one—isn’t worth the investment.
          The risk you’re investigating is, “Will people accept rides from
          others?” It’s emphatically not, “Can I build software to match
          drivers and passengers?” A Concierge MVP won’t scale, but it’s fast
          and easy in the short term.</p><p>Now that it’s cheap, even free, to launch a startup, the
          really scarce resource is attention. A concierge approach in which
          you run things behind the scenes for the first few customers lets
          you check whether the need is real; it also helps you understand
          which things people really use and refine your process before
          writing a line of code or hiring a single employee.</p></div><p>Initial tests of Airbnb’s MVP showed that professionally
        photographed listings got <span class="emphasis"><em>two to three times</em></span> more
        bookings than the market average. This validated the founders’ first
        hypothesis. And it turned out that hosts were wildly enthusiastic
        about receiving an offer from Airbnb to take those photographs for
        them.</p><p>In mid-to-late 2011, Airbnb had 20 photographers in the field
        taking pictures for hosts—roughly the same time period where we see
        the proverbial “hockey stick” of growth in terms of nights booked,
        shown in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#itapostrophes_amazing_what_you_can_do_wi" title="Figure 1-1. It’s amazing what you can do with 20 photographers and people’s apartments">Figure 1-1</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="itapostrophes_amazing_what_you_can_do_wi"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00002"/><img alt="It’s amazing what you can do with 20 photographers and people’s apartments" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989260.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 1-1. It’s amazing what you can do with 20 photographers and
          people’s apartments</div></div><p>Airbnb experimented further. It watermarked photos to add
        authenticity. It got customer service to offer professional
        photography as a service when renters or potential renters called in.
        It increased the requirements on photo quality. Each step of the way,
        the company measured the results and adjusted as necessary. The key
        metric Airbnb tracked was shoots per month, because it had already
        proven with its Concierge MVP that more professional photographs meant
        more bookings.</p><p>By February 2012, Airbnb was doing nearly 5,000 shoots per month
        and continuing to accelerate the growth of the professional
        photography program.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Airbnb’s team had a hunch that better photos would increase
            rentals.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They tested the idea with a Concierge MVP, putting the least
            effort possible into a test that would give them valid

            necessary components and rolled it out to all customers.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Analytics Lessons
        Learned</strong></span></p><p>Sometimes, growth comes from an aspect of your business you
        don’t expect. When you think you’ve found a worthwhile idea, decide
        how to test it quickly, with minimal investment. Define what success
        looks like beforehand, and know what you’re going to do if your hunch
        is right.</p><p>Lean is a great way to build businesses. And analytics ensures
        that you’ll collect and analyze data. Both fundamentally transform how
        you think about starting and growing a company. Both are more than
        processes—they’re mindsets. Lean, analytical thinking is about asking
        the right questions, and focusing on the one key metric that will
        produce the change you’re after.</p><p>With this book, we hope to provide you with the guidance, tools,
        and evidence to embrace data as a core component of your startup’s
        success. <span class="emphasis"><em>Ultimately, we want to show you how to use data to
