      usually delivered through a website it operates. Salesforce, Gmail,
      Basecamp, and Asana are all examples of popular SaaS products. If you’re
      running a SaaS business, here’s what you need to know about
      metrics.</p><p>Most SaaS providers generate revenue from a monthly (or yearly)
      subscription that users pay. Some charge on a consumption basis—for
      storage, for bandwidth, or for compute cycles—although this is largely
      confined to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service
      (PaaS) cloud computing companies today.</p><p>Many SaaS providers offer a tiered model of their service, where
      the monthly fee varies depending on some dimension of the application.
      This might be the number of projects in a project management tool, or
      the number of customers in a customer relationship management
      application. Finding the best mix of these tiers and prices is a
      constant challenge, and SaaS companies invest considerable effort in
      finding ways to upsell a user to higher, more lucrative tiers.</p><p>Because the incremental cost of adding another customer to a SaaS
      service is negligible—think of how little it costs Skype to add a new
      user—many SaaS providers use a freemium model of customer
      acquisition.<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.ch09fn01" id="ch09fn01">29</a>]</sup> Customers can start using a free version of the service
      that’s constrained, in the hopes <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1071"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1150"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1232"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1265"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1327"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1409"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1476"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1708"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2026"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2031"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2141"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2251"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2293"/>that they’ll consume all the free capacity and pay for
      more. Dropbox, for example, gives subscribers a few gigabytes of storage
      for free, then does everything it can—including encouraging sharing and
      photo uploads—to make sure users consume that capacity.</p><p>Consider a project management startup that lets users try its
      product, but charges for more than three concurrent projects. It offers
      four tiers: free, 10 projects, 100 projects, and unlimited. It runs ads
      on several platforms to attract users to its site, and each time a user
      invites someone else to join a project, that person becomes a
      user.</p><p>The company cares about the following key metrics:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Attention</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>How effectively the business attracts visitors.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Enrollment</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>How many visitors become free or trial users, if you’re

      customer’s lifecycle: the company acquires a user through viral or paid
      marketing. Hopefully, that user continues to use the service, and
      eventually pays for a subscription. The user invites others, and perhaps
      upgrades to a higher tier. As a customer, she may have issues. In the
      end, she stops using the service—at which point, we know how much
      revenue she contributed to the business.</p><p>Describing a customer lifecycle in this way is a good method for
      understanding the key metrics that drive your business. This is where
      Lean Startup helps. You need to know <span class="emphasis"><em>which aspects of your
      business are too risky</em></span> and then work to improve the metric
      that represents that risk.</p><p>Unfortunately, that’s not always possible. There’s no way to
      measure conversion rates if there are no users to convert. You can’t
      quantify virality if no paid customers are inviting new users. And you
      probably can’t measure stickiness for just a few people if the service
      requires a critical mass of users to be useful. This means you have to
      <span class="emphasis"><em>know where the risk is</em></span>, but focus, in the right
      order, on <span class="emphasis"><em>just enough optimization to get the business to a
      place where that risk can be quantified and
      understood</em></span>.</p><p>Let’s say that the company in our example is concerned about
      whether the product is good enough to make people use it consistently.
      This is usually the right place to focus for SaaS companies, because
      they seldom get a second chance to make a first impression, and need
      users to keep coming back. In other words, they care about
      stickiness.</p><p>The company will, of course, need some amount of conversion (and
      therefore some amount of attention), but <span class="emphasis"><em>only enough to test
      stickiness</em></span>. Those initial users could be acquired by word of
      mouth, or by direct selling, or by engaging with users on social
      networks. There’s probably no need for a full-blown, automated marketing
      campaign at this stage.</p><div class="sect1 case_study" title="Backupify’s Customer Lifecycle Learning"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_backupifyapostrophes_customer" style="clear: both">Backupify’s Customer Lifecycle Learning</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1082"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1140"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1166"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1219"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1275"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1287"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1292"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1666"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1751"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1757"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1990"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2023"/>Backupify is a leading backup provider for cloud-based
        data. The company was founded in 2008 by Robert May and Vik Chadha,
        and has gone on to raise $19.5M in several rounds of financing.</p><p>Backupify was good at focusing on a specific metric at a
        specific stage, in order to grow the company. “Initially, we focused
        on site visitors, because we just wanted to get people to our site,”
        said CEO and co-founder Robert May. “Then we focused on trials,
        because we needed people testing out our product.”</p><p>Once Backupify had people trialing the product in sufficient
        numbers, Robert focused on signups (conversions from free trial to
        paying customer). Now, the primary focus is <span class="emphasis"><em>monthly
        recurring revenue</em></span> (MRR).</p><p>The cloud storage industry has matured a lot in a handful of
        years, but back in 2008 it was a nascent market. At the time, the
        company was focused on consumers and realized that, while revenue was
        going up, the customer acquisition cost (CAC) was too high. “In early
        2010 we were paying $243 to acquire a customer, who only paid us $39
        per year,” explained Robert. “Those are horrible economics. Most
        consumer apps get around the high acquisition costs with some sort of
        virality, but backup isn’t viral. So we had to pivot [from consumer
        sales] to go after businesses.”</p><p>The pivot for Backupify was a success. The company is growing
        successfully. For now, it remains focused on MRR, but it also tracks
        how much a customer is worth in the entirety of his relationship with
        the company—the customer lifetime value (CLV). CLV and CAC are the two
        essential metrics for a subscription business.</p><p>In Backupify’s case, the ratio of CLV to CAC is 5–6x, meaning
        that for every dollar the company invests in finding a customer, it
        makes back $5 to $6. This is excellent, and it’s partly due to its low
        churn. As it turns out, lock-in is high for cloud storage, which gives
        the company plenty of time to make back its acquisition costs in the
        form of revenues. We’ll look at the CAC/CLV ratio in more detail later
        in the book.</p><p>“MRR growth will probably be our top metric until we hit $10M in
        annual recurring revenue,” said Robert. “I watch churn, but I’m more
        focused on customer acquisition payback in months, which is how
        quickly I make my money back on each customer.” Robert’s target for
        that metric is 12 months or less for any given channel. Customer
        acquisition payback is a great example of a single number <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1400"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1427"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1623"/>that encompasses many things, since it rolls up
        marketing efficiency, customer revenue, cash flow, and churn
        rate.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Before focusing on sophisticated financial metrics, start
            with revenue. But don’t ignore costs, because profitability is the
            real key to growth.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You know it’s time to scale when your paid engine is humming
            along nicely, which happens when the CAC is a small fraction of
            the CLV—a sure sign you’re getting a good return on your
            investment.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Most SaaS businesses thrive on monthly recurring
            revenue—customers continue to pay month after month—which is a
            great foundation on which to build a business.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Analytics Lessons
        Learned</strong></span></p><p>There’s a natural progression of metrics that matter for a
        business that change over time as the business evolves. The metrics
        start by tracking questions like “Does anyone care about this at all?”
        and then get more sophisticated, asking questions like “Can this
        business actually scale?” As you start to look at more sophisticated
        metrics, you may realize your business model is fundamentally flawed
        and unsustainable. Don’t just start from scratch: sometimes what you
        need is a new market, not a new product, and that market may be closer
        than you think.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Measuring Engagement"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="measuring_engagement" style="clear: both">Measuring Engagement</h2></div></div></div><p>The ultimate metric for engagement is daily use. How many of
        your customers use your product on a daily basis? If your product
        isn’t a daily use app, establishing a minimum baseline of engagement
        takes longer, and the time it takes to iterate through a cycle of
        learning is longer. It’s also hard to demonstrate enough value,
        quickly enough, to keep people from churning. Habits are hard to
        form—and with any new product, you’re creating new habits, which you
        want to do as quickly and intensely as possible.</p><p>Evernote is an example of a daily use application (at least, its
        creators would like you to use it on a daily basis!). The people who
        pay for Evernote are most likely those who use it daily. Evernote has
        reported that only 1% of users convert into paid customers,<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch09fn02" id="ch09fn02">30</a>]</sup> but for CEO Phil Libin that’s OK—after all, the company
        has over 40 million users, and this year it’s focused <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1085"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1435"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1502"/>further on engagement, which is why it’s acquiring
        companies like Skitch and adding image upload features.</p><p>After years of operation, the company has also learned that
        users take months or even years to become paying customers. Investors
        likely agree with the company’s focus on engagement, since they’re
        giving the company deep cash reserves to keep growing. In other words,
        conversion isn’t Evernote’s main concern right now, although once it
        improves engagement that’s absolutely what it will concentrate
        on.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch09fn03" id="ch09fn03">31</a>]</sup></p><p>Consider two other applications we use heavily but don’t
        consider daily use applications: Expensify for expense reporting, and
        Balsamiq for wireframing. Just because <span class="emphasis"><em>we</em></span> don’t
        use them every day doesn’t mean that a travelling sales rep, or a UI
        designer, isn’t a daily user.</p><p>That’s an important lesson around business models and Lean
        Startup—you bring an early version of your product to the market, test
        its usage, and look for where it’s got the highest engagement among
        your customers. If there’s a subsection of users who are hooked on
        your product—your early adopters—figure out what’s common to them,
        refocus on their needs, and grow from there. Claim your beachhead. It
        will allow you to iterate much more quickly on a highly engaged
        segment of the market.</p><p>Some applications—such as a wedding gift registry, a reservation
        tool for a visit to the dentist, or a tax preparation site—simply
        aren’t meant to be used on a daily basis. But you still need to set a
        high bar for engagement and measure against it. It’s critical that you
        understand customers’ behavior, and draw lines in the sand appropriate
        to that. Perhaps the goal is weekly or monthly use.</p><p>If you’re building something genuinely disruptive, you need to
        consider the technology adoption lifecycle, from early to mainstream.
        Hybrid cars, Linux servers, home stereos, and microwaves were first
        adopted by a small segment of their markets, but took years of
        evangelism and millions of marketing dollars to be considered
        conventional.</p><p>In the first stages of your company, you typically have a small,
        devoted, unreasonably passionate following. This happens because new
        products initially appeal only to early adopters comfortable with
        change, or to that segment of the market so desperate for your
        solution that it’s willing to tolerate something that’s still rough
        around the edges. Those early adopters will be vocal, but beware.
        Their needs might not reflect those of the bigger, more lucrative
        mainstream. Google Wave attracted a flurry of early attention, but
        failed to achieve mainstream interest despite its powerful, flexible
        feature set.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1192"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1285"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1752"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2313"/>You hope your first users are reflective of the
        mainstream, so you can reach a bigger market—something Geoffrey Moore
        famously referred to as “crossing the chasm.” This isn’t always the
        case. You also won’t have the same volume of metrics on which to base
        your decisions.</p><p>When measuring engagement, don’t just look at a coarse metric
        like visit frequency. Look for usage patterns throughout your
        application. For example, it’s interesting to know that people log in
        three times per week, but what are they actually doing inside your
        application? What if they’re only spending a few minutes each time? Is
        that good or bad? Are there specific features they’re using versus
        others? Is there one feature that they always use, and are there
        others they never touch? Did they return of their own accord, or in
        response to an email?</p><p>Finding these engagement patterns means analyzing data in two
        ways:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>To find ways you might improve things, segment users who do
            what you want from those who don’t, and identify ways in which
            they’re different. Do the engaged users all live in the same city?
            Do all users who eventually become loyal contributors learn about
            you from one social network? Are the users who successfully invite
            friends all under 30 years old? If you find a concentration of
            desirable behavior in one segment, you can then target it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>To decide whether a change worked, test the change on a
            subset of your users and compare that subset’s results to others.
            If you put in a new reporting feature, reveal it to half of your
            users, and see if more of them stick around for several months. If
            you can’t test features in this way without fallout—the customers
            who <span class="emphasis"><em>didn’t</em></span> get the new feature might get
            angry—then at the very least, compare the cohort of users who
            joined after the feature was added to those who came
            before.</p></li></ul></div><p>A data-driven approach to measuring engagement should show you
        not only <span class="emphasis"><em>how sticky</em></span> your product or service is,
        but also <span class="emphasis"><em>who stuck and whether your efforts are paying
        off</em></span>.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Churn"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="churn" style="clear: both">Churn</h2></div></div></div><p>Churn is the percentage of people who abandon your service over
        time. This can be measured weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc., but you
        should pick a timespan for all your metrics and stick to it in order
        to make comparing them easier. In a freemium or free-trial business
        model, you have both users (not paid) and customers (paid), and you
        should track churn for both groups separately. While churn might seem
        like a simple metric, there are a number of complications that can
        make it misleading, particularly for companies that have a highly
        variable growth rate.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1479"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1539"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1792"/>Unpaid users “churn” by cancelling their accounts or
        simply not coming back; paid users churn by cancelling their accounts,
        stopping their payments, or reverting to an unpaid version. We
        recommend defining an inactive user as someone who hasn’t logged in
        within 90 days (or less). At that point, they’ve churned out; in an
        always-connected world, 90 days is an eternity.</p><p>Remember, however, that you may still be able to invite them
        back to the service later if you have significant feature upgrades—as
        Path did when it redesigned its application—or if you’ve found a way
        to reach them with daily content, as Memolane did when it sent users
        memories from past years.</p><p>As Shopify data scientist Steven H.

        users, active users, and paying users. Active users are those who have
        logged in at least once in the month after signing up. New users are
        growing at 20% a month, 30% use the service at least once (in the
        month after signing up), and 2% convert into paid customers.</p><p>Here’s the churn calculation for February:</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00021a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00021"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989279.png"/></div></div><p>If 2.5% of customers churn every month, it means that the
        average customer stays around for 40 months (100/2.5). This is how you
        can start to calculate the lifetime value of a customer (40 months ×
        average monthly revenue per user).</p><div class="sect2" title="Churn Complications"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="churn_complications">Churn Complications</h3></div></div></div><p>Noble explains that because the number of churns in a
          particular period is affected by the entire period, but the number
          of customers at the beginning of a period is a moment-in-time
          snapshot, calculating churn in this simple manner can give
          misleading results in startups where growth is varied or unusually
          fast. In other words, churn isn’t normalized for behavior and
          size—you can get different churn rates for the same kind of user
          behavior if you’re not careful.</p><p>To fix this, you need to calculate churn in a less simple, but
          more accurate, way: average out the number of customers in the
          period you’re analyzing, so you’re not just looking at how many you
          had at the beginning:</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00022a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00022"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989280.png"/></div></div><p>This spreads out the total number of customers across the
          period, which is better, but it still presents a problem if things
          are growing quickly. If you have 100 customers at the start of the
          month, and 10,000 at the end, this formula assumes you have 5,050
          customers in the middle of the month—which you don’t, if you’re on a
          hockey stick. Most of your new customers come in the later part of
          the month, so an average won’t work. What’s more, most of your
          churns will, too.</p><p>Worse: if you’re counting churns as “someone who hasn’t come
          back in 30 days,” then you’re comparing last month’s losses to this
          month’s gains, which is even more dangerous, because you’re looking
          at a lagging indicator (last month’s bad news). So by the time you
          find out something is wrong, it’ll be next month.</p><p>Ultimately, the math gets really complex. There are two ways
          to simplify it. The first is to measure churn <span class="emphasis"><em>by
          cohort</em></span>, so you’re comparing new to <a class="indexterm" id="iddle2034"/>churned users based on when they first became users.
          The second way is really, really simple, which is why we like it:
          measure churn each day. The shorter the time period you measure, the
          less that changes during that specific period will distort
          things.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Visualizing the SaaS Business"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="visualizing_the_saas_business" style="clear: both">Visualizing the SaaS Business</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="xref" href="ch09.html#visitorscomma_userscomma_customers_the_l" title="Figure 9-1. Visitors, users, customers: the life of a SaaS company">Figure 9-1</a>

        aimed at helping small businesses find job candidates and predict
        their success. When they started, founders Ben Baldwin and Jamie
        Schneiderman offered a $99/month (per job posting) package. “We kept
        hearing over and over that monthly subscriptions were the key to
        growing a successful SaaS business,” says Ben. “So that’s the
        direction we took, but it didn’t work as planned.”</p><p>Two things confused ClearFit’s customers: the price point and
        the monthly subscription. Ben and Jamie wanted to price ClearFit below
        what customers paid for job boards (typically more than $300 per job
        posting), but customers were so used to that price point that they
        were skeptical of ClearFit’s value at $99/month. Ben says, “We don’t
        compete with job boards, we partner with them, but at the time it
        seemed reasonable to have a lower price point to garner attention.”
        Customers didn’t understand why they would pay a subscription fee for
        something that they would most likely use sporadically. “When a
        company needs to hire, they want to do it fast and they’re willing to
        invest at that moment in time,” says Ben. “Our customers are too small
        to have dedicated HR staff or recruiters that are constantly looking
        for talent, and their hiring needs go up and down frequently.”</p><p>Ben and Jamie decided to abandon their low monthly subscription
        and switch to a model that their customers understood: a per-job fee.
        ClearFit launched its new price point at $350 for a single job (for 30
        days) and almost immediately saw three times the sales. The increase
        in volume and the higher price point improved revenue tenfold. “When
        we increased the price,” Ben says, “it was an important signal to our
        customers. They understood the model and could more easily compare the
        value against other solutions they use. Even though what we do is
        different than a job board, we wanted our customers to feel
        comfortable with purchasing from us, and we wanted to fit into how
        they budget for recruiting.”</p><p>In ClearFit’s case, innovating on the business model didn’t make
        sense. Ben says, “People don’t do subscriptions for haircuts,
        hamburgers, and hiring. You have to understand your customer, who they
        are, how and why they buy, and how they value your product or
        service.”</p><p>ClearFit’s switch to a per-job-posting model may go against the
        popular grain of subscription-based SaaS businesses, but the company
        continues to see great success with 30% month-over-month revenue
        growth.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1481"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2035"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2200"/><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>ClearFit initially focused on a subscription model for

        Learned</strong></span></p><p>Just because SaaS is a recurring service doesn’t mean it needs
        to be priced that way. If your product is ephemeral—like a transient
        job posting—it might be better to offer more transactional pricing.
        Pricing is a tricky beast. You need to test different price points
        qualitatively (by getting feedback from customers) and quantitatively.
        Don’t assume a low price is the answer; customers might not attribute
        enough value to your offering. And remember that everything, including
        price, makes up the “product” you’re offering.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Wrinkles: Freemium, Tiers, and Other Pricing Models"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="wrinkles_freemiumcomma_tierscomma_and_ot" style="clear: both">Wrinkles: Freemium, Tiers, and Other Pricing Models</h2></div></div></div><p>In a SaaS model, most of the complexity comes from two things:
        the promotional approach you choose, and pricing tiers.</p><p>As we’ve seen, some SaaS companies use a freemium model to
        convince people to use the service, and then make money when those
        users exceed some kind of cap. A second approach is a free trial,
        which converts to a paid subscription if the customer doesn’t
        explicitly cancel after a certain time. A third approach is paid-only.
        There are others. Each has its benefits and drawbacks—paid-only
        controls cost, is more predictable, and gives you an immediate idea of
        whether your offering is valuable; freemium allows you to learn how
        people are using your service and builds goodwill. The difference
        between these user groups can complicate analysis.</p><p>The second wrinkle comes from how you tier pricing. Since
        different customers have different levels of consumption, the price
        they pay may change over time. This means you’re constantly trying to
        upsell users to bigger tiers, and predicting growth adds to the
        dimensions of a model, making it harder to predict and explain your
        business.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2025"/>For the most part, we’ve talked about SaaS as a service
        provided to customers on a monthly subscription. But there are other
        revenue models that can work as well. While a subscription model lends
        itself to more predictive financial planning and less volatile revenue
        numbers, it doesn’t always fit the value proposition, or how customers
        expect to pay.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Key Takeaways"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="key_takeaways-id00001" style="clear: both">Key Takeaways</h2></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>While freemium gets a lot of visibility, it’s actually a
