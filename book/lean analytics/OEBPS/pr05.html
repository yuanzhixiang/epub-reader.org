    entrepreneurs. It helps you identify the riskiest parts of your business
    plan, then finds ways to reduce those risks in a quick, iterative cycle of
    learning. Most of its insights boil down to one sentence: <span class="emphasis"><em>Don’t
    sell what you can make; make what you can sell</em></span>. And that means
    figuring out what people want to buy.</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s hard to know what people really want. Many
    times, they don’t know themselves. When they tell you, it’s often what
    they think you want to hear.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.pref03fn01" id="pref03fn01">1</a>]</sup> What’s worse, as a founder and entrepreneur, you have
    strong, almost overwhelming preconceptions about how other people think,
    and these color your decisions in subtle and insidious ways.</p><p>Analytics can help. Measuring something makes you accountable.
    You’re forced to confront inconvenient truths. And you don’t spend your
    life and your money building something nobody wants.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Lean Startup</em></span> helps you structure your progress
    and identify the riskiest parts of your business, then learn about them
    quickly so you can adapt. <span class="emphasis"><em>Lean Analytics</em></span> is used to
    measure that progress, helping you to ask the most important questions and
    get clear answers quickly.</p><p>In this book we show you how to figure out your business model and
    your stage of growth. We’ll explain how to find the One Metric That
    Matters to you right now, and how to draw a line in the sand so you know
    when to step on the gas and when to slam on the brakes.</p><p>Lean Analytics is the dashboard for every stage of your business,
    from validating whether a problem is real, to identifying your customers,
    to deciding what to build, to positioning yourself favorably with a
    potential acquirer. It can’t force you to act on data—but it can put that
    data front and center, making it harder for you to ignore, and preventing
    you from driving off the road entirely.</p><div class="sect1" title="Who This Book Is For"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="who_this_book_is_for" style="clear: both">Who This Book Is For</h2></div></div></div><p>This book is for the entrepreneur trying to build something
      innovative. We’ll walk you through the analytical process, from idea
      generation to achieving product/market fit and beyond, so this book both
      is for those starting their entrepreneurial journey as well as those in
      the middle of it.</p><p>Web analysts and data scientists may also find this book useful,
      because it shows how to move beyond traditional “funnel visualizations”
      and connect their work to more meaningful business discussions.
      Similarly, business professionals involved in product development,
      product management, marketing, public relations, and investing will find
      much of the content relevant, as it will help them understand and assess
      startups.</p><p>Most of the tools and techniques we’ll cover were first applied to
      consumer web applications. Today, however, they matter to a far broader
      audience: independent local businesses, election managers,
      business-to-business startups, rogue civil servants trying to change the
      system from within, and “intrapreneurs” innovating within big,
      established organizations.<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.pref03fn02" id="pref03fn02">2</a>]</sup></p><p>In that respect, <span class="emphasis"><em>Lean Analytics</em></span> is for anyone
      trying to make his or her organization more effective. As we wrote this
      book, we talked with tiny family businesses, global corporations,
      fledgling startups, campaign organizers, charities, and even religious
      groups, all of whom were putting lean, analytical approaches to work in
      their organizations.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="How This Book Works"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="how_this_book_works" style="clear: both">How This Book Works</h2></div></div></div><p>There’s lots of information in this book. We interviewed over a
      hundred founders, investors, intrapreneurs, and innovators, many of whom
      shared <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1107"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1289"/>their stories with us, and we’ve included more than 30
      case studies. We’ve also listed more than a dozen best-practice patterns
      you can apply right away. And we’ve broken the content into four big
      parts.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="xref" href="pt01.html" title="Part I. Stop Lying to Yourself">Part I</a> focuses on an
          understanding of Lean Startup and basic analytics, and the
          data-informed mindset you’ll need to succeed. We review a number of
          existing frameworks for building your startup and introduce our own,
          analytics-focused one. This is your primer for the world of Lean
          Analytics. At the end of this section, you’ll have a good
          understanding of fundamental analytics.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="xref" href="pt02.html" title="Part II. Finding the Right Metric for Right Now">Part II</a>
          shows you how to apply Lean Analytics to your startup. We look at
          six sample business models and the five stages that every startup
          goes through as it discovers the right product and the best target
          market. We also talk about finding the One Metric That Matters to
          your business. When you’re done, you’ll know what business you’re
          in, what stage you’re at, and what to work on.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="xref" href="pt03.html" title="Part III. Lines in the Sand">Part III</a> looks at what’s normal.
          Unless you have a line in the sand, you don’t know whether you’re
          doing well or badly. By reading this section, you’ll get some good
          baselines for key metrics and learn how to set your own
          targets.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="xref" href="pt04.html" title="Part IV. Putting Lean Analytics to Work">Part IV</a> shows you
          how to apply Lean Analytics to your organization, changing the
          culture of consumer- and business-focused startups as well as
          established businesses. After all, data-driven approaches apply to
          more than just new companies.</p></li></ul></div><p>At the end of most chapters, we’ve included questions you can
      answer to help you apply what you’ve read.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The Building Blocks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="building_blocks" style="clear: both">The Building Blocks</h2></div></div></div><p>Lean Analytics doesn’t exist in a vacuum. We’re an extension of
      Lean Startup, heavily influenced by customer development and other
      concepts that have come before. It’s important to understand those
      building blocks before diving in.</p><div class="sect2" title="Customer Development"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="customer_development">Customer Development</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Customer development</em></span>—a term coined by
        entrepreneur and professor Steve Blank—took direct aim at the
        outdated, “build it and they will come” waterfall method of building
        products and companies. Customer development is focused on collecting
        continuous feedback that will have a material impact on the direction
        of a product and business, every step of the way.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1322"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1471"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1613"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2011"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2138"/>Blank first defined customer development in his book
        <span class="emphasis"><em>The Four Steps to the Epiphany</em></span> (Cafepress.com)
        and refined his ideas with Bob Dorf in <span class="emphasis"><em>The Startup Owner’s
        Manual</em></span> (K &amp; S Ranch). His definition of a startup is
        one of the most important concepts in his work:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>A startup is an organization formed to search for a
          scalable and repeatable business model.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Keep that definition in mind as you read the rest of this
        book.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Lean Startup"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="lean_startup">Lean Startup</h3></div></div></div><p>Eric Ries defined the Lean Startup process when he combined
        customer development, Agile software development methodologies, and
        Lean manufacturing practices into a framework for developing products
        and businesses quickly and efficiently.</p><p>First applied to new companies, Eric’s work is now being used by
        organizations of all sizes to disrupt and innovate. After all, Lean
        isn’t about being cheap or small, it’s about eliminating waste and
        moving quickly, which is good for organizations of any size.</p><p>One of Lean Startup’s core concepts is
            <span class="emphasis"><em>build</em></span>→<span class="emphasis"><em>measure</em></span>→<span class="emphasis"><em>learn</em></span>—the
          process by which you do everything, from establishing a vision to building product
          features to developing channels and marketing strategies, as shown in <a class="xref" href="pr05.html#buildrarrmeasurerarrlearn_cycle" title="Figure 1. The build→measure→learn cycle">Figure 1</a>. Within that cycle, <span class="emphasis"><em>Lean
            Analytics</em></span> focuses on the <span class="emphasis"><em>measure</em></span> stage. The faster your
          organization iterates through the cycle, the more quickly you’ll find the right
          product and market. If you measure better, you’re more likely to succeed.</p><div class="figure"><a id="buildrarrmeasurerarrlearn_cycle"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00001"/><img alt="The build→measure→learn cycle" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989259.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 1. The build→measure→learn cycle</div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1124"/>The cycle isn’t just a way of improving your product.
        It’s also a good reality check. Building the minimum product necessary
        is part of what Eric calls <span class="emphasis"><em>innovation accounting</em></span>,
        which helps you objectively measure how you’re doing. Lean Analytics
        is a way of quantifying your innovation, getting you closer and closer
        to a continuous reality check—in other words, to reality
        itself.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="We’d Like to Hear from You"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="weapostrophed_like_to_hear_from_you" style="clear: both">We’d Like to Hear from You</h2></div></div></div><p>Please address comments and questions concerning this book to the

It was more
      of a team effort than most, with dozens of founders, investors, and
      innovators sharing their stories online and off. Our personal blog
      readers, as well as the hundreds of subscribers to our Lean Analytics
      blog who gave us feedback, deserve much of the credit for the clever
      parts; we deserve all of the blame for the bad bits.</p><p>Mary Treseler was the voice of our readers and called us out when
      we strayed too far into jargon. Our families stayed amazingly patient
      and helped with several rounds of reading and editing. We sent early
      copies of critical chapters to reviewers, who verified our assumptions
      and checked our math, and many of them contributed so much useful
      feedback that they’re practically co-authors. Sonia Gaballa of Nudge
      Design did great work with our website, and the production team at
      O’Reilly put up with our unreasonable demands and constant changes. And
      folks at Totango, Price Intelligently, Chartbeat, Startup Compass, and
      others all dug into anonymized customer data to enlighten us on things
      like Software as a Service, pricing, engagement, and average
      metrics.</p><p>But most of all, we want to thank people who challenged us, shared
      with us, and opened their kimonos to tell us the good and bad parts of
      startups, often having to fight for approval to talk publicly. Some
      weren’t able to, despite their best efforts, and we’ll leave their
      stories for another day—but every piece of feedback helped shape this
      book and our understanding of how analytics and Lean Startup methods
      intertwine.</p></div><div class="footnotes" epub:type="footnotes"><br/><hr style="width: 100; align: left;"/><div class="footnote" id="ftn.pref03fn01"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#pref03fn01">1</a>] </sup><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jerrymclaughlin/2012/05/01/would-you-do-this-to-boost-sales-by-20-or-more/" target="_top">http://www.forbes.com/sites/jerrymclaughlin/2012/05/01/would-you-do-this-to-boost-sales-by-20-or-more/</a></em></span></p></div><div class="footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="ftn.pref03fn02"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#pref03fn02">2</a>] </sup>An intrapreneur is an entrepreneur within a large
