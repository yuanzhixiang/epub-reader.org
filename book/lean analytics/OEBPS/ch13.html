      sites, but they’re different enough to warrant a separate discussion.
      If, after reading <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. What Business Are You In?">Chapter 7</a>, you’ve concluded
      that you’re running this kind of company, here’s what you need to
      know.</p><p>In this model, the company makes money when a buyer and seller
      come together to complete a transaction. While eBay is undoubtedly the
      most famous example of a two-sided marketplace, the underlying pattern
      is fairly common. Consider the following business models, all of which
      have an aspect of a two-sided market:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Real estate listing services allow prospective buyers to
          identify properties by a wide range of criteria, and then extract a
          fee for setting up the transaction, either as a one-time cost or a
          percentage.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Indiegogo lets artists list projects and collect the support
          of backers. Backers are able to browse projects and find those they
          want to support. The site takes a percentage of monies
          raised.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>eBay and Craigslist let sellers list and promote items, and
          let buyers purchase from them. In the case of Craigslist, a very
          small number of transactions (rentals in certain cities, for
          example) cost money, making the rest of the site free.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>App stores let software developers list their wares in
          exchange for sharing the revenues. The app store not only handles
          the catalog of apps and the delivery, it also distributes updates,
          helps with litigation, and manages currency transactions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1176"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1306"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1532"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1902"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2086"/>Dating sites allow an inventory of prospective
          partners to browse one another, and charge a fee for completing an
          introduction or for revealing additional information in a paid
          subscription.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Hotwire and Priceline let hotels list additional inventory,
          then find buyers willing to buy it at a discount. They hide the
          identity of the hotel until after the purchase.</p></li></ul></div><p>All of these examples include a shared inventory model and two
      stakeholders—buyers and sellers, creators and supporters, prospective
      partners,<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.ch13fn01" id="ch13fn01">49</a>]</sup> or hotels and travellers. They all make money when the two
      stakeholders come together, and they often differentiate based on a
      particular set of search parameters or qualifications (e.g., apartments
      that have been vetted, seller ratings). And they all need an inventory
      to get started.</p><p>In this section, we’re going to define two-sided marketplaces more
      narrowly, which will exclude some of the aforementioned examples. In our
      definition:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The seller is responsible for listing and promoting the
          product. A real estate service that simply publishes realtor
          listings wouldn’t qualify, but a for-sale-by-owner site
          would.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The marketplace owner has a “hands off” approach to the
          individual transactions. Sites like Hotwire that create the hotel
          profiles wouldn’t be included.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The buyer and seller have competing interests. In most
          marketplace models the seller wants to extract as much money as
          possible, while the buyer wants to spend as little as possible. In a
          dating site, regardless of gender differences, both parties have a
          shared interest—a compatible partner—so we’ll leave them out of this
          discussion.</p></li></ul></div><p>Two-sided marketplaces face a unique problem: they have to attract
      both buyers and sellers. That looks like twice as much work. As we’ll
      see in some of the case studies ahead, companies like DuProprio/Comfree,
      Etsy, Uber, and Amazon found ways around this dilemma, but they all boil
      down to one thing: <span class="emphasis"><em>focus on whomever has the money</em></span>.
      Usually, that’s buyers: if you can find a group that wants to
      <span class="emphasis"><em>spend</em></span> money, it’s easy to find a group that wants
      to <span class="emphasis"><em>make</em></span> money.</p><div class="sect1 case_study" title="What DuProprio Watches"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_what_duproprio_watches" style="clear: both">What DuProprio Watches</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1029"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1034"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1115"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1282"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1331"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1469"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1581"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2223"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2317"/>DuProprio/Comfree is the largest for-sale-by-owner
        marketplace, and second-most-visited real estate network in Canada.
        Founded in 1997 by co-president Nicolas Bouchard, it lists 17,000
        properties and has roughly 5 million visits a month. The company
        charges a one-time fee of around $900 for a listing, assistance with
        pricing, signage, and HDR photography. Additional tools, from legal
        advice to real estate coaching, are available for an extra fee. The
        company also has affiliate listing relationships with a prominent
        newspaper.</p><p>Nicolas was Lean before Lean came along. The son of a realtor
        and an entrepreneur from a young age—already running a hardwood
        flooring business while in high school—he helped his father build a
        website in the early days of the Web. Then he had an epiphany. “I
        started to notice the black-and-orange ‘for sale by owner’ signs in
        hardware stores. So I made the connection, and said, ‘let’s do a real
        estate website for owners.’ I launched it in my parents’
        basement.”</p><p>The first version of the website was static, built on Microsoft
        Frontpage. There was no staff. Nicolas acquired new sellers by
        scouring the classified ads and driving around looking for “for sale
        by owner” signs, convincing sellers to list with his site. “Back then,
        the only KPI was the number of signs we had on people’s lawns—because
        that’s how buyers found my website,” he recalls. “That, and of course,
        the number of properties listed on the website.”</p><p>Gradually, Nicolas found other sources of potential sellers,
        looking at sites like Craigslist and Kijiji. “It was the beginning of
        the Internet,” he says. “I was still playing with how to pitch the
        service and how to use the Web to my advantage, and that of my
        clients.”</p><p>In early 2000, once the company had found some traction, it
        switched from a static site to a dynamic one, and manually transferred
        all the seller listings to the new site. Until that point, it had only
        rudimentary analytics—little more than a page hit counter. It added
        Webtrends for analytics. With the dynamic version of the site came a
        seller login, which allowed sellers to update data on their property
        by themselves. “At this point, sellers could see more about how they
        were doing, including how many times their listing appeared in search
        results, how many times the listing was clicked, and so on,” he
        says.</p><p>A couple of years later, the company added client-side logins.
        This allowed prospective buyers to set their search criteria, and
        eventually to subscribe to notifications when suitable properties came
        up for sale. The emphasis was on search.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1267"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1495"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2168"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2173"/>“With the advent of the dynamic site, we tracked the
        number of visitors versus the number of seller subscriptions, because
        that’s bread and butter to us,” says Nicolas. But the data still
        wasn’t precise: the company was still focusing on visits, not
        visitors.</p><p>One reason for this was that the two-sided marketplace was more
        complicated than it might seem. Often, someone selling a house was
        also looking for a new one—which made it hard to segment traffic
        cleanly between the two groups—so Nicolas settled for a simple rule of
        thumb. “At some point we had a metric that 1,000 visits on the website
        equals 1 subscription.” Despite the coarseness of this baseline, it
        was enough to draw a line in the sand. “This was a rudimentary
        conversion rate,” he says. “The objective was to generate more
        conversions per visit.”</p><p>As the company became more sophisticated about analysis, it
        improved its analytics further. “We started to look at the conversion
        rate of visitors coming to the subscription page, where we display the
        various packages we offer,” he says. “We started to be a bit more
        disciplined, but this was long before we did any real A/B testing.”
        The company was making modifications to its website to see if they
        improved conversions or the visits-to-listings ratio, but this was
        still a month-by-month process.</p><p>While the company has detailed analytics from Google today,
        Nicolas doesn’t concern himself with details. “There are always more
        visitors looking to buy a property,” he points out. He also doesn’t
        focus as much on buyer-side account creation. “In Québec alone, we
        have 3 millions visits a month, and 1.2 million unique visitors a
        month, but only a small fraction of those—5% or less—create an
        account.”</p><p>Nicolas does care a lot about competitors, however. “We want to
        be as good as possible, and better than real estate agents. We have
        data from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and the Canadian
        Real Estate Board, so we know exactly how many properties were listed
        and sold. We benchmark ourselves against these numbers all the time,
        region by region.”</p><p>Today, the company has three big goals. It wants to convince
        sellers to list their property on the site, it wants to convince
        buyers to register for notifications when a property becomes
        available, and it wants to sell the properties.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1208"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1729"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1820"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2119"/>DuProprio is a great example of how a company moves
        through several stages as it grows. The metrics the company tracked
        changed over time:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Early on, a static site was fine—the focus was on
            acquisition (signs on lawns, volume of houses listed).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Then its focus shifted to the visitor-to-listing ratio,
            which was a measure of whether the marketplace was healthy.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>As the marketplace emerged, it focused on revenue metrics
            such as the list-to-sold ratio, and the average package sale
            price.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Now it’s adding new metrics to optimize the email
            click-through rate, search results, and use of its recently
            launched mobile applications. “Currently, because of the way the
            system is built, it’s hard to know where blank searches are
            occurring on the website, but it’s something we’re working
            on.”</p></li></ul></div><p>Ultimately, in this two-sided marketplace, Nicolas has clearly
        chosen to focus on the source of the money.</p><p>“For us, today, one big metric is the number of sales. An even
        bigger metric than that is the sold-to-list ratio: what’s the total
        number of properties listed versus the total number of properties
        sold,” he says. “If the property doesn’t sell, we don’t have a
        business. There will be no word of mouth, no good reviews, no 15,000
        testimonials from satisfied sellers, no ‘I sold’ stickers on lawn
        signs. Even if tomorrow I’m listing 10,000 more properties, if no
        properties are selling, I’m dead.”</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Early on, a marketplace can grow its inventory by hand,

        Learned</strong></span></p><p>Start with the minimum marketplace that proves you have demand,
        supply, and a desire for buyers and sellers to transact. Then find
        ways of making money from that activity. The metrics you track will
        depend on transaction size, frequency, and other unique
        characteristics of the business. But the fundamentals are the same:
        revenue from transactions.</p><p>Imagine you’re launching a two-sided marketplace for secondhand
        game consoles. Those with a console to sell can list it, and those
        looking for a console to buy can browse by a variety of criteria. The
        transactions are handled through PayPal, and you retain a portion of
        the proceeds above a minimum amount.</p><p>Because you’re not a vendor of consoles yourself, you need to
        find a way to produce <span class="emphasis"><em>either</em></span> an inventory of
        consoles, <span class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> a large group of customers. You need
        to pick which side of the market you’re going to “seed.”</p><p>If you want to seed the seller side, you might crawl Craigslist
        and approach console owners to see if they have inventory, encouraging
        them to list items. If you want to seed the buyer side, you might set
        up a forum for nostalgic game players, bringing them together and
        inviting them from social sites.</p><p>You could create an artificial inventory by selling consoles to
        start with, and then gradually adding inventory from others.
        Car-service provider Uber overcame the chicken-and-egg problem in new
        markets by simply buying up available towncars: when the company
        launched in Seattle, it paid drivers $30 an hour to drive passengers
        around, and switched to a commission model only once it had sufficient
        demand to make it worthwhile for the drivers. <span class="emphasis"><em>The company
        created supply</em></span>.</p><p>On the other hand, if you want to seed the buyer side, you
        probably need to pick something for which you can command an initial
        inventory, then purchase some; or you might take orders with a promise
        of fulfilling them later, knowing you have access to that inventory.
        Amazon, for example, started selling books, which allowed it to
        streamline its order, search, and logistics processes. Then it could
        offer a broader range of its own goods. Eventually, with access to
        many buyers and their search patterns, Amazon became a marketplace for
        goods from many other suppliers. Salesforce.com created a CRM product,
        and then created an app exchange ecosystem where third-party
        developers could sell software to existing customers. With respect to
        their marketplace offerings, <span class="emphasis"><em>both companies first created
        demand</em></span>.</p><p>The health of their chicken-and-egg-defeating strategy was a
        critical metric:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1121"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1401"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1472"/>For Uber, this meant measuring how much drivers
            would be making on a commission basis, as well as the inventory
            and the time it took a driver to pick up a customer. When those
            metrics were sustainable (with a reasonable margin of error), it
            was time to switch from the “artificial” market of paid drivers to
            the “sustainable” two-sided marketplace of commissions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>For Amazon, this meant measuring the number of retained book
            buyers who were comfortable with the purchase and delivery
            process, and then trying out new offerings, such as electronics or
            kitchenware, that those buyers might purchase.</p></li></ul></div><p>The first step of a two-sided marketplace—and the first thing to
        measure—is your ability to create an inventory (supply) or an audience
        (demand). DuProprio looked for “for sale by owner” signs and
        classified listings to build its initial set of listings, and the
        seller’s lawn sign then drove buyer traffic, so its metrics were
        listings and lawn signs. The metrics you’ll care about first are
        around the attraction, engagement, and growth of this seed
        group.</p><p>Josh Breinlinger, a venture capitalist at Sigma West who
        previously ran marketing at labor marketplace oDesk, breaks up the key
        marketplace metrics into three categories: buyer activity, seller
        activity, and transactions. “I almost always recommend modeling the
        buyer side as your primary focus, and then you model supply, more in
        the sense of total inventory,” he says. “It’s easy to find people that
        want to make money; it’s much harder to find people that want to spend
        money.”</p><p>Josh cautions that just tracking buyer, seller, and inventory
        numbers isn’t enough: you have to be sure those numbers relate to the
        actual activity that’s at the core of your business model. “If you
        wanted to juice those numbers you could do so quite easily by tweaking
        algorithms, but you’re not necessarily providing a better experience
        to users,” he says. “I believe the better focus is on more explicit
        marketplace activity like bids, messages, listings, or
        applications.”</p><p>Once you’ve got both sides of the market together, your
        attention (and analytics) will shift to maximizing the proceeds from
        the market—the number of listings, the quality of buyers and sellers,
        the percentage of searches for which you have at least one item in
        inventory, the marketplace-specific metrics Josh mentions, and
        ultimately, the sales volume and resulting revenue. You’ll also focus
        on understanding what makes a listing desirable so you can attract
        more like it. And you’ll start tracking fraud and bad offerings that
        can undermine the quality of the marketplace and send buyers and
        sellers away.</p><p>Our game console company starts by tracking the growth of buyers
        within the marketplace, and their interest in sellers’ listings. To
        track buyers, we start by tracking visitors who aren’t sellers (see
        <a class="xref" href="ch13.html#site_visitors_left_parenthesispotential" title="Table 13-1. Site visitors (potential buyers)">Table 13-1</a>). One
        useful metric is the ratio of buyers to sellers—a higher number should

        improve: inventory, conversion rate, search results, content quality,
        and so on. For example, if you’re not getting enough click-through
        from search results to individual listings, you can show less

        two-sided marketplace. But the metrics listed here focus specifically
        on the creation of a fluid market with buyers and sellers coming
        together.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Rate at Which You’re Adding Buyers and Sellers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="rate_at_which_youapostrophere_adding_buy" style="clear: both">Rate at Which You’re Adding Buyers and Sellers</h2></div></div></div><p>This metric is particularly important in the early stages of the
        business. If you’re competing with others, then your line in the sand
        is an inventory of sellers that’s comparable to that of your
        competitors, so it’s worth a buyer’s time to search you. If you’re in
        a relatively unique market, then your line in the sand is enough
        inventory that buyers’ searches are returning one or more valid
        results.</p><p>Track the change in these metrics over periods of time to
        understand if things are getting better or worse. You’re already
        tracking the sellers and listings, but what you really want to know is
        how fast those numbers are growing.</p><p>This makes it easier to pinpoint changes that are worth
        investigating. You’ll want to track how fast you’re adding sellers to
        the marketplace and whether the rate of addition is growing or
        slowing. If it’s growing, then you may want to focus on onboarding new
        sellers so they become active and list inventory right away; if it’s
        stalling, then you may want to spend more money to find new sellers or
        focus on increasing the number of listings per seller as well as the
        conversion rate of those listings.</p><p>Long-term, you can always buy supply, but you can’t buy demand.
        In an attention economy, having an engaged, attentive user base is
        priceless. It’s the reason Walmart can coerce favorable terms from
        suppliers and that Amazon can build a network of merchants even though
        it’s a seller itself. When it comes to sustainable competitive
        advantage, <span class="emphasis"><em>demand beats supply</em></span>.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Rate of Inventory Growth"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="rate_of_inventory_growth" style="clear: both">Rate of Inventory Growth</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1562"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2062"/>In addition to sellers, you need to track listings they
        create. Focus on the number of listings per seller and whether that’s
        growing, as well as the completeness of those listings (are sellers
        completing the description of their offering?).</p><p>A bigger inventory means more searches are likely to yield
        results. If you start to saturate your marketplace (i.e., if most of
        the sellers in your market have already become members), then your
        growth will come from increasing their listings and the effectiveness
        of those listings.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Buyer Searches"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="buyer_searches" style="clear: both">Buyer Searches</h2></div></div></div><p>In many two-sided markets, searches are the primary way in which
        buyers find sellers. You need to track the number of searches that
        return no results—this is a lost sales opportunity. For example, you

        Auctions</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1178"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2230"/>In the early days of the Web, pundits predicted an open,
        utopian world of frictionless markets that were transparent and
        efficient. But as Internet giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook
        have shown, parts of the Web are dystopian. Two-sided marketplaces are
        subject to strong network effects—the more inventory they have to
        offer, the more useful they become. A marketplace with no inventory,
        on the other hand, is useless.</p><p>Successful two-sided marketplaces find a way to artificially
        populate either the buyer or the seller side early on. As a particular
        niche matures, this network effect means there will be a few dominant
        players—as is the case with Airbnb, VRBO, and a few others in the
        rental property space.</p><p>Fraud and trust are the other big issues for such marketplaces.
        You don’t want to assume responsibility for the delivery of goods or
        services within your marketplace, but you need to ensure that there
        are reliable reputation systems. Buyer and seller ratings are one
        approach to this, but there are other ways. Some dating sites offer
        guarantees (for example, that they will prosecute if a person turns
        out to be married).</p><p>One more major issue is keeping the transaction within the
        network. In the case of a sailboat or house marketplace, the
        transaction may be tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars.
        That’s not really suitable for a PayPal transaction, and it’s hard to
        stop “leakage”—buyers and sellers find one another through your
        marketplace, and then conclude their business without you getting a
        transaction fee.</p><p>There are a number of ways to overcome this—all of which you
        should test to see if they work for your product and market. For
        example, you might:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Refer users to an outside agent to conclude the transaction
            (e.g., a realtor) and monetize the referral.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Charge a fee (instead of a percentage) proportional to the
            value of the item the seller is listing.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Monetize something else about the market, such as in-site
            advertising, shipping services, or favorable placement.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Make it impossible for the two parties to connect or find
            each other’s identity until after the transaction is confirmed (as
            discount travel site Hotwire does).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Offer value-added services (such as purchase insurance or
            escrow) that encourage participants to keep you in the
            deal.</p></li></ul></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1072"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1333"/>Finally, there are auction marketplaces such as eBay
        where the price of an item isn’t fixed. The seller may set the minimum
        price, as well as a “Buy now” value, but the final price is what the
        market is willing to pay. If this is your model, you’ll need to
        analyze how many sales failed to receive a bid (indicating
        overpricing), how many sold for the “Buy now” price (indicating
        underpricing), and the duration and outcome of auctions. You might use
        this information to improve the prices your sellers set—and your
        resulting revenues.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Key Takeaways"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="key_takeaways-id00006" style="clear: both">Key Takeaways</h2></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Two-sided markets come in all shapes and sizes.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Early on, the big challenge is solving the “chicken and egg”
