You
      have to measure your assumptions in the right order. To do that, you
      need to know what stage you’re at.</p><p>Our Lean Analytics stages suggest an order to the metrics you
      should focus on. The stages won’t apply perfectly to everyone. We’ll
      probably get yelled at for being so prescriptive—in fact, we already
      have, as we’ve tested the material for the book online and in events.
      That’s OK; we have thick skins.</p><p>In a startup, your business <span class="emphasis"><em>model</em></span>—and proof
      that your assumptions are reasonably accurate—is far more important than
      your business <span class="emphasis"><em>plan</em></span>. Business plans are for bankers;
      business models are for founders. Deciding what business you’re in is
      usually quite easy. Deciding on the <span class="emphasis"><em>stage</em></span> you’re at
      is complicated. This is where founders tend to lie to themselves. They
      believe they’re further along than they really are.</p><p>The reality is that every startup goes through stages, beginning
      with problem discovery, then building something, then finding out if
      what was built is good enough, then spreading the word and collecting
      money. These stages—Empathy, Stickiness, Virality, Revenue, and
      Scale—closely mirror what other Lean Startup advocates advise.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>First, you need <span class="emphasis"><em>empathy</em></span>. You need to get
          inside your target market’s head and be sure you’re solving a
          problem people care about in a way someone will pay for. That means
          getting out of the building, interviewing people, and running
          surveys.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1992"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2039"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2142"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2297"/>Second, you need <span class="emphasis"><em>stickiness</em></span>,
          which comes from a good product. You need to find out if you can
          build a solution to the problem you’ve discovered. There’s no point
          in promoting something awful if your visitors will bounce right off
          it in disgust. Companies like Color that attempted to scale
          prematurely, without having proven stickiness, haven’t fared
          well.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Third, you need <span class="emphasis"><em>virality</em></span>. Once you’ve got
          a product or service that’s sticky, it’s time to use word of mouth.
          That way, you’ll test out your acquisition and onboarding processes
          on new visitors who are motivated to try you, because you have an
          implied endorsement from an existing user. Virality is also a force
          multiplier for paid promotion, so you want to get it right before
          you start spending money on customer acquisition through inorganic
          methods like advertising.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Fourth, you need <span class="emphasis"><em>revenue</em></span>. You’ll want to
          monetize things at this point. That doesn’t mean you haven’t already
          been charging—for many businesses, even the first customer has to
          pay. It just means that earlier on, you’re less focused on revenue
          than on growth. You’re giving away free trials, free drinks, or free
          copies. Now you’re focused on maximizing and optimizing
          revenue.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Fifth, you need <span class="emphasis"><em>scale</em></span>. With revenues
          coming in, it’s time to move from growing your business to growing
          your market. You need to acquire more customers from new verticals
          and geographies. You can invest in channels and distribution to help
          grow your user base, since direct interaction with individual
          customers is less critical—you’re past product/market fit and you’re
          analyzing things quantitatively.</p></li></ol></div><p>So, as we shared in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Analytics Frameworks">Chapter 5</a>, we
      suggest these five Lean Analytics stages, and we believe you should go
      through them in the order shown in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#why_we_put_the_five_stages_of_lean_analy" title="Figure 14-1. Why we put the five stages of Lean Analytics in that order">Figure 14-1</a>, unless you have a
      really good reason to do otherwise.</p><p>While many of the examples we’ve looked at are technology
      companies—and many of those are B2C (business to consumer)
      companies—these five stages apply equally well to a restaurant as they
      do to an enterprise software company.</p><div class="figure"><a id="why_we_put_the_five_stages_of_lean_analy"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00033"/><img alt="Why we put the five stages of Lean Analytics in that order" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989294.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 14-1. Why we put the five stages of Lean Analytics in that

            the area, their desires, what foods aren’t available, and trends
            in eating.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Stickiness:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Stickiness:</strong></span></strong></span> Then he develops a menu and tests it out with consumers,
            making frequent adjustments until tables are full and patrons
            return regularly. He’s giving things away, testing things, and
            asking diners what they think. Costs are high because of variance
            and uncertain inventory.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Virality:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Virality:</strong></span></strong></span> He starts loyalty programs to bring frequent diners back, or
            to encourage people to share with their friends. He engages on
            Yelp and Foursquare.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Revenue:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Revenue:</strong></span></strong></span> With virality kicked off, he works on margins—fewer free
            meals, tighter controls on costs, and more standardization.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Scale:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Scale:</strong></span></strong></span> Finally, knowing he can run a profitable business, he pours
            some of the revenues into marketing and promotion. He reaches out
            to food reviewers, travel magazines, and radio stations. He
            launches a second restaurant, or a franchise based on the initial
            one.</p></li></ol></div><p>Now consider a company selling software to large
      enterprises:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p title="Empathy:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Empathy:</strong></span></strong></span> <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1389"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2005"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2052"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2159"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2311"/>The founder finds an unmet need because she has a
            background in a particular industry and has worked with existing
            solutions that are being disrupted.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Stickiness:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Stickiness:</strong></span></strong></span> She meets with an initial group of prospects and signs
            contracts that look more like consulting agreements, which she
            uses to build an initial product. She’s careful not to commit to
            exclusivity, and tries to steer customers toward standardized
            solutions, charging heavily for custom features. Her engineers
            handle customer support directly, rather than having an
            “insulating layer” of support staff in this early stage, so they
            have to confront the warts and wrinkles of what they’ve
            created.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Virality:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Virality:</strong></span></strong></span> Product in hand, she asks for references from satisfied
            customers and uses those as testimonials. She starts direct sales
            and grows the customer base. She launches a user group and starts
            to automate support. She releases an API, encouraging third-party
            development and scaling potential market size without direct
            development.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Revenue:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Revenue:</strong></span></strong></span> She focuses on growing the pipeline, sales margins, and
            revenues while controlling costs. Tasks are automated, outsourced,
            or offshored. Feature enhancements are scored based on anticipated
            payoff and development cost. Recurring license and support revenue
            becomes an increasingly large component of overall
            revenues.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Scale:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Scale:</strong></span></strong></span> She signs deals with large distributors, and works with
            global consulting firms to have them deploy and integrate her
            tool. She attends trade shows to collect leads, carefully
            measuring cost of acquisition against close rate and lead
            value.</p></li></ol></div><p>We’ll continue to use these five stages and correlate them to
      other frameworks as we did in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Analytics Frameworks">Chapter 5</a>.
      We’ll also outline the individual gates that you need to pass through as
      you move from one stage to the next.<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.ch14fn01" id="ch14fn01">50</a>]</sup></p><p>We care a lot about company stage because the metrics you focus on
      will be significantly impacted by the stage of your business. Premature
      focus or optimization of things that don’t really matter is a surefire
      way of killing your startup. So let’s dig into the five Lean Analytics
      stages.</p><div class="sect1 exercise" title="Pick the Stage That You’re At"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="exercise_pick_the_stage_that_youapostrop" style="clear: both">Pick the Stage That You’re At</h2></div></div></div><p>What stage do you think you’re at? Write it down. After reading
        the following chapters on the five Lean Analytics stages, see if your
        answer changes. It will likely require more detail as well—zeroing in
        on a specific aspect of a stage that you’re focused on (for example,
        problem validation or solution validation in the Empathy stage). You
        may be overlapping between stages, too, so read them all before
        deciding.</p></div><div class="footnotes" epub:type="footnotes"><br/><hr style="width: 100; align: left;"/><div class="footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="ftn.ch14fn01"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#ch14fn01">50</a>] </sup>It’s worth pointing out that Lean founders consider payment,
          virality, and stickiness three Engines of Growth, and that a company
          can pivot from one to the next. We prefer to think of them as three
          things to optimize: a good startup has payment (and investment in
          customer acquisition), stickiness (and recurring revenue), and
          virality (and the resulting word of mouth). You can focus on one at
          a time, but we think you should build all three—and their related
          metrics—into your startup as you grow.</p></div></div></section></body></html>
