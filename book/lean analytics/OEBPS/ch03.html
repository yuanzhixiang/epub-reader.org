      next few years of your life working on. The reason you want to be lean
      and analytical about the process is so that you don’t waste your life
      building something nobody wants. Or, as Netscape founder and venture
      capitalist Marc Andreesen puts it, <span class="emphasis"><em>“Markets that don’t exist
      don’t care how smart you are.”</em></span><sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch03fn01" id="ch03fn01">11</a>]</sup></p><p>Hopefully, you have an idea of what you want to build. It’s your
      blueprint, and it’s what you’ll test with analytics. You need a way of
      quickly and consistently articulating your hypotheses around that idea,
      so you can go and verify (or repudiate) them with real customers. To do
      this, we recommend Ash Maurya’s Lean Canvas, which lays out a clear
      process for defining and adjusting a business model based on customer
      development. We’ll discuss Ash’s model later in this chapter.</p><p>But the canvas is only half of what you need. It’s not just about
      finding a business that works—you also need to find a business that you
      want to work on. Strategic consultant, blogger, and designer Bud Caddell
      has three clear criteria for deciding what to spend your time on:
      something that you’re good at, that you want to do, and that you can
      make money doing.</p><p>Let’s look at the Lean Canvas and Bud’s three criteria in more
      detail.</p><div class="sect1" title="The Lean Canvas"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="lean_canvas" style="clear: both">The Lean Canvas</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1125"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1295"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1661"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1849"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1909"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2123"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2248"/>The Lean Canvas is a one-page visual business plan
        that’s ongoing and actionable. It was created by Ash Maurya, and
        inspired by Alex Osterwalder’s Business Model Canvas.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch03fn02" id="ch03fn02">12</a>]</sup> As you can see in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#you_can_describe_your_entire_business_in" title="Figure 3-1. You can describe your entire business in nine small boxes">Figure 3-1</a>, it consists of
        nine boxes organized on a single sheet of paper, designed to walk you
        through the most important aspects of any business.</p><div class="figure"><a id="you_can_describe_your_entire_business_in"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00006"/><img alt="You can describe your entire business in nine small boxes" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989264.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 3-1. You can describe your entire business in nine small
          boxes</div></div><p>The Lean Canvas is fantastic at identifying the areas of biggest
        risk and enforcing intellectual honesty. When you’re trying to decide
        if you’ve got a real business opportunity, Ash says you should
        consider the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p title="Problem:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Problem:</strong></span></strong></span> Have you identified real problems people know they

        enlightening experience, and well worth the effort.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="What Should You Work On?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="what_should_you_work_onquestion_mark" style="clear: both">What <span class="emphasis"><em>Should</em></span> You Work On?</h2></div></div></div><p>The Lean Canvas provides a formal framework to help you choose
        and steer your business. But there’s another, more human, side to all
        of this.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Do you want to do it?</em></span></p><p>This doesn’t get asked enough. Investors say they look for
        passionate founders who really care about solving a problem. But it’s
        seldom called out as something to which you should devote much
        thought. If you’re going to survive as a founder, you have to find the
        intersection of demand (for your product), ability (for you to make
        it), and desire (for you to care about it).</p><p>That trifecta is often overlooked, withering under the harsh
        light of data and a flood of customer feedback. But it shouldn’t.
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Don’t start a business you’re going to hate</em></span>. Life
        is too short, and your weariness will show.</p><p>Bud Caddell has an amazingly simple diagram of how people should
        choose what to work on, shown in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#bud_caddellapostrophes_diagram_belongs_o" title="Figure 3-2. Bud Caddell’s diagram belongs on every career counselor’s wall">Figure 3-2</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="bud_caddellapostrophes_diagram_belongs_o"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00007"/><img alt="Bud Caddell’s diagram belongs on every career counselor’s wall" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989265.png.jpg"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 3-2. Bud Caddell’s diagram belongs on every career counselor’s
          wall</div></div><p>Bud’s diagram shows three overlapping rings: what you
        <span class="emphasis"><em>like</em></span> to do, what you’re <span class="emphasis"><em>good
        at</em></span>, and what you <span class="emphasis"><em>can be paid</em></span> to do.
        For each intersection between rings, he suggests a course of
        action:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>If you want to do something and are good at it, but can’t be
            paid to do it, <span class="emphasis"><em>learn to monetize</em></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you’re good at something and can be paid to do it, but
            don’t like doing it, <span class="emphasis"><em>learn to say no</em></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you like to do something and can be paid to do it, but
            aren’t very good at it, <span class="emphasis"><em>learn to do it
            well</em></span>.</p></li></ul></div><p>This isn’t just great advice for career counselors; when
        launching a new venture, you need to properly assess these three
        dimensions as well.</p><p>First, ask yourself: <span class="emphasis"><em>can I do this thing I’m hoping to
        do, well?</em></span> This is about your ability to satisfy your
        market’s need better than your competitors, and it’s a combination of
        design skill, coding, branding, and myriad other factors. If you
        identify a real need, you won’t be the only one satisfying it, and
        you’ll need all the talent you can muster in order to succeed. Do you
        have a network of friends and contacts who can give you an unfair
        advantage that improves your odds? Do you have the talent to do the
        things that matter <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> well? <span class="emphasis"><em>Never
        start a company on a level playing field—that’s where everyone else is
        standing</em></span>.</p><p>These same rules apply to people working in larger
        organizations. Don’t launch a new product or enter a new market unless
        your existing product and market affords you an unfair advantage.
        Young competitors with fewer legacies will be fighting you for market
        share, and your size should be an advantage, not a handicap.</p><p>Second, figure out <span class="emphasis"><em>whether you like doing this
        thing</em></span>. Startups will consume your life, and they’ll be a
        constant source of aggravation. Your business will compete with your
        friends, your partner, your children, and your hobbies. You need to
        believe in what you’re doing so that you’ll keep at it and ride
        through the good times and the bad. Would you work on it even if you
        weren’t being paid? Is it a problem worth solving, that you’ll brag
        about to others? Is it something that will take your career in the
        direction you want, and give you the right reputation within your
        existing organization? If not, maybe you should keep looking.</p><p>Finally, be sure <span class="emphasis"><em>you can make money doing
        it</em></span>.<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.ch03fn03" id="ch03fn03">13</a>]</sup> This is about the market’s need. You have to be able to
        extract enough money from customers for the value you’ll deliver, and
        do so without spending a lot to acquire those customers—and the
        process of acquiring them and extracting their money has to scale
        independent of you as a founder.</p><p>For an intrapreneur, this question needs to be answered simply
        to get approval for the project, but remember that you’re fighting the
        opportunity cost—whatever the organization could be doing instead, or
        the profitability of the existing business. If what you’re doing isn’t
        likely to have a material impact on the bottom line, maybe you should
        look elsewhere.</p><p>This is by far the most important of the three; the other two
        are easy, because they’re up to you. But now you have to figure out if
        anyone will pay you for what you can and want to build.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1609"/>In the early stages of a startup, you’ll be dealing with
        a lot of data. You’re awash in the tides of opinion, and buffeted by
        whatever feedback you’ve heard most recently.</p><p>Never forget that you’re trying to answer three fundamental
        questions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Have I identified a problem worth solving?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Is the solution I’m proposing the right one?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Do I actually want to solve it?</p></li></ul></div><p>Or, more succinctly: <span class="emphasis"><em>should I go build this
        thing?</em></span></p></div><div class="sect1 exercise" title="Create a Lean Canvas"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="exercise_create_a_lean_canvas" style="clear: both">Create a Lean Canvas</h2></div></div></div><p>Go to <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://leancanvas.com" target="_top">http://leancanvas.com</a></em></span> to create your first
        canvas. Pick an idea or project you’re working on now, or something
        you’ve been thinking about. Spend 20 minutes on the canvas and see
        what it looks like. Fill in the boxes based on the numbered order, but
        feel free to skip boxes that you can’t fill out. We’ll wait.</p><p>How did you do? Can you see what areas of your idea or business
        are the riskiest? Are you excited about tackling those areas of risk
        now that you see them described in the canvas? If you’re confident,
        share your Lean Canvas with someone else (an investor, advisor, or
        colleague) and use it as a discussion starter.</p></div><div class="footnotes" epub:type="footnotes"><br/><hr style="width: 100; align: left;"/><div class="footnote" id="ftn.ch03fn01"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#ch03fn01">11</a>] </sup><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://pmarca-archive.posterous.com/the-pmarca-guide-to-startups-part-4-the-only" target="_top">http://pmarca-archive.posterous.com/the-pmarca-guide-to-startups-part-4-the-only</a></em></span></p></div><div class="footnote" id="ftn.ch03fn02"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#ch03fn02">12</a>] </sup><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas" target="_top">http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas</a></em></span></p></div><div class="footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="ftn.ch03fn03"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#ch03fn03">13</a>] </sup>Not everyone is hoping to make money with his or her
