      to your business. Usually, those metrics matter because they relate to
      your business model—where money comes from, how much things cost, how
      many customers you have, and the effectiveness of your customer
      acquisition strategies.</p><p>In a startup, you don’t always know which metrics are key, because
      you’re not entirely sure what business you’re in. You’re frequently
      changing the activity you analyze. You’re still trying to find the right
      product, or the right target audience. In a startup, the purpose of
      analytics is <span class="emphasis"><em>to find your way to the right product and market
      before the money runs out</em></span>.</p><div class="sect1" title="What Makes a Good Metric?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="what_makes_a_good_metricquestion_mark" style="clear: both">What Makes a Good Metric?</h2></div></div></div><p>Here are some rules of thumb for what makes a good metric—a
        number that will drive the changes you’re looking for.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>A good metric is comparative.</strong></span>
        Being able to compare a metric to other time periods, groups of users,
        or competitors helps you understand which way things are moving.
        “Increased conversion from last week” is more meaningful than “2%
        conversion.”</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>A good metric is
        understandable.</strong></span> If people can’t remember it and discuss it,
        it’s much harder to turn a change in the data into a change in the
        culture.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1961"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1962"/><span class="strong"><strong>A good metric is a ratio or a
        rate.</strong></span> Accountants and financial analysts have several
        ratios they look at to understand, at a glance, the fundamental health
        of a company.<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.ch02fn01" id="ch02fn01">5</a>]</sup> You need some, too.</p><p>There are several reasons ratios tend to be the best
        metrics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p title="Ratios are easier to act on."><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Ratios are easier to act
              on.</strong></span></strong></span> Think about driving a car. Distance travelled is
              informational. But speed—distance per hour—is something you can
              act on, because it tells you about your current state, and
              whether you need to go faster or slower to get to your
              destination on time.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Ratios are inherently comparative."><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Ratios are inherently
              comparative.</strong></span></strong></span> If you compare a daily metric to the same metric over a
              month, you’ll see whether you’re looking at a sudden spike or a
              long-term trend. In a car, speed is one metric, but speed right
              now over average speed this hour shows you a lot about whether
              you’re accelerating or slowing down.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Ratios are also good for comparing factors that are somehow opposed, or for which there’s an inherent tension."><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Ratios are also good for
              comparing factors that are somehow opposed, or for which there’s
              an inherent tension.</strong></span></strong></span> In a car, this might be distance covered divided by
              traffic tickets. The faster you drive, the more distance you
              cover—but the more tickets you get. This ratio might suggest
              whether or not you should be breaking the speed limit.</p></li></ul></div><p>Leaving our car analogy for a moment, consider a startup with
        free and paid versions of its software. The company has a choice to
        make: offer a rich set of features for free to acquire new users, or
        reserve those features for paying customers, so they will spend money
        to unlock them. Having a full-featured free product might reduce
        sales, but having a crippled product might reduce new users. You need
        a metric that combines the two, so you can understand how changes
        affect overall health. Otherwise, you might do something that
        increases sales revenue at the expense of growth.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>A good metric changes the way you
        behave.</strong></span> This is by far the most important criterion for a
        metric: what will you do differently based on changes in the
        metric?</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>“Accounting” metrics like daily sales revenue, when entered
            into your spreadsheet, need to make your predictions more
            accurate. These metrics form the basis of Lean Startup’s
            <span class="emphasis"><em>innovation accounting</em></span>, showing you how close
            you are to an ideal model and whether your actual results are
            converging on your business plan.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1455"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1491"/>“Experimental” metrics, like the results of a test,
            help you to optimize the product, pricing, or market. Changes in
            these metrics will significantly change your behavior. Agree on
            what that change will be before you collect the data: if the pink
            website generates more revenue than the alternative, you’re going
            pink; if more than half your respondents say they won’t pay for a
            feature, don’t build it; if your curated MVP doesn’t increase
            order size by 30%, try something else.</p></li></ul></div><p>Drawing a line in the sand is a great way to enforce a
        disciplined approach. A good metric changes the way you behave
        precisely <span class="emphasis"><em>because</em></span> it’s aligned to your goals of
        keeping users, encouraging word of mouth, acquiring customers
        efficiently, or generating revenue.</p><p>Unfortunately, that’s not always how it happens.</p><p>Renowned author, entrepreneur, and public speaker Seth Godin
        cites several examples of this in a blog post entitled “Avoiding false
        metrics.”<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch01fn02" id="ch01fn02">6</a>]</sup> Funnily enough (or maybe not!), one of Seth’s examples,
        which involves car salespeople, recently happened to Ben.</p><p>While finalizing the paperwork for his new car, the dealer said
        to Ben, “You’ll get a call in the next week or so. They’ll want to
        know about your experience at the dealership. It’s a quick thing,
        won’t take you more than a minute or two. It’s on a scale from 1 to 5.
        You’ll give us a 5, right? Nothing in the experience would warrant
        less, right? If so, I’m very, very sorry, but a 5 would be
        great.”</p><p>Ben didn’t give it a lot of thought (and strangely, no one ever
        did call). Seth would call this a <span class="emphasis"><em>false metric</em></span>,
        because the car salesman spent more time asking for a good rating
        (which was clearly important to him) than he did providing a great
        experience, which was supposedly what the rating was for in the first
        place.</p><p>Misguided sales teams do this too. At one company, Alistair saw
        a sales executive tie quarterly compensation to the number of deals in
        the pipeline, rather than to the number of deals closed, or to margin
        on those sales. Salespeople are coin-operated, so they did what they
        always do: they followed the money. In this case, that meant a glut of
        junk leads that took two quarters to clean out of the pipeline—time
        that would have been far better spent closing qualified
        prospects.</p><p>Of course, customer satisfaction or pipeline flow is vital to a
        successful business. But if you want to change behavior, your metric
        must be tied to the behavioral change you want. If you measure
        something and it’s not <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1014"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1163"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1259"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1271"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1439"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1594"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1600"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1685"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1693"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1695"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1704"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1715"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1940"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1948"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1963"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1982"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2205"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2270"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2283"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2285"/>attached to a goal, in turn changing your behavior,
        you’re wasting your time. Worse, you may be lying to yourself and
        fooling yourself into believing that everything is OK. That’s no way
        to succeed.</p><p>One other thing you’ll notice about metrics is that they often
        come in pairs. <span class="emphasis"><em>Conversion rate</em></span> (the percentage of
        people who buy something) is tied to
        <span class="emphasis"><em>time-to-purchase</em></span> (how long it takes someone to
        buy something). Together, they tell you a lot about your cash flow.
        Similarly, <span class="emphasis"><em>viral coefficient</em></span> (the number of
        people a user successfully invites to your service) and
        <span class="emphasis"><em>viral cycle time</em></span> (how long it takes them to
        invite others) drive your adoption rate. As you start to explore the
        numbers that underpin your business, you’ll notice these pairs. Behind
        them lurks a fundamental metric like revenue, cash flow, or user
        adoption.</p><p>If you want to choose the right metrics, you need to keep five
        things in mind:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Qualitative versus quantitative
            metrics</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>Qualitative metrics are unstructured, anecdotal,
              revealing, and hard to aggregate; quantitative metrics involve
              numbers and statistics, and provide hard numbers but less
              insight.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Vanity versus actionable metrics</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>Vanity metrics might make you feel good, but they don’t
              change how you act. Actionable metrics change your behavior by
              helping you pick a course of action.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Exploratory versus reporting
            metrics</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>Exploratory metrics are speculative and try to find
              unknown insights to give you the upper hand, while reporting
              metrics keep you abreast of normal, managerial, day-to-day
              operations.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Leading versus lagging metrics</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>Leading metrics give you a predictive understanding of the
              future; lagging metrics explain the past. Leading metrics are
              better because you still have time to act on them—the horse
              hasn’t left the barn yet.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Correlated versus causal metrics</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>If two metrics change together, they’re correlated, but if
              one metric <span class="emphasis"><em>causes</em></span> another metric to change,
              they’re causal. If you find a causal relationship between
              something you want (like revenue) and something you can control
              (like which ad you show), then you can change the future.</p></dd></dl></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1015"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1578"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1588"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1705"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1716"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1946"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1952"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1964"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2273"/>Analysts look at specific metrics that drive the
        business, called <span class="emphasis"><em>key performance indicators</em></span>
        (KPIs). Every industry has KPIs—if you’re a restaurant owner, it’s the
        number of covers (tables) in a night; if you’re an investor, it’s the
        return on an investment; if you’re a media website, it’s ad clicks;
        and so on.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Qualitative Versus Quantitative Metrics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="qualitative_versus_quantitative_metrics" style="clear: both">Qualitative Versus Quantitative Metrics</h2></div></div></div><p>Quantitative data is easy to understand. It’s the numbers we
        track and measure—for example, sports scores and movie ratings. As
        soon as something is ranked, counted, or put on a scale, it’s
        quantified. Quantitative data is nice and scientific, and (assuming
        you do the math right) you can aggregate it, extrapolate it, and put
        it into a spreadsheet. But it’s seldom enough to get a business
        started. You can’t walk up to people, ask them what problems they’re
        facing, and get a quantitative answer. For that, you need qualitative
        input.</p><p>Qualitative data is messy, subjective, and imprecise. It’s the
        stuff of interviews and debates. It’s hard to quantify. You can’t
        measure qualitative data easily. If quantitative data answers “what”
        and “how much,” qualitative data answers “why.” <span class="emphasis"><em>Quantitative
        data abhors emotion; qualitative data marinates in
        it</em></span>.</p><p>Initially, you’re looking for qualitative data. You’re not
        measuring results numerically. Instead, you’re speaking to
        people—specifically, to people you think are potential customers in
        the right target market. You’re exploring. <span class="emphasis"><em>You’re getting
        out of the building</em></span>.</p><p>Collecting good qualitative data takes preparation. You need to
        ask specific questions without leading potential customers or skewing
        their answers. You have to avoid letting your enthusiasm and reality
        distortion rub off on your interview subjects. Unprepared interviews
        yield misleading or meaningless results.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Vanity Versus Real Metrics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="vanity_versus_real_metrics" style="clear: both">Vanity Versus Real Metrics</h2></div></div></div><p>Many companies claim they’re data-driven. Unfortunately, while
        they embrace the <span class="emphasis"><em>data</em></span> part of that mantra, few
        focus on the second word: <span class="emphasis"><em>driven</em></span>. If you have a
        piece of data on which you cannot act, it’s a vanity metric. If all it
        does is stroke your ego, it won’t help. You want your data to inform,
        to guide, to improve your business model, to help you decide on a
        course of action.</p><p>Whenever you look at a metric, ask yourself, “What will I do
        differently based on this information?” If you can’t answer that
        question, you probably shouldn’t worry about the metric too much. And
        if you don’t know which <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1815"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2271"/>metrics <span class="emphasis"><em>would</em></span> change your
        organization’s behavior, you aren’t being data-driven. You’re
        floundering in data quicksand.</p><p>Consider, for example, “total signups.” This is a vanity metric.
        The number can only increase over time (a classic “up and to the
        right” graph). It tells us nothing about what those users are doing or
        whether they’re valuable to us. They may have signed up for the
        application and vanished forever.</p><p>“Total active users” is a bit better—assuming that you’ve done a
        decent job of defining an active user—but it’s still a vanity metric.
        It will gradually increase over time, too, unless you do something
        horribly wrong.</p><p>The real metric of interest—the <span class="emphasis"><em>actionable</em></span>
        one—is “percent of users who are active.” This is a critical metric
        because it tells us about the level of engagement your users have with
        your product. When you change something about the product, this metric
        should change, and if you change it in a good way, it should go up.
        That means you can experiment, learn, and iterate with it.</p><p>Another interesting metric to look at is “number of users
        acquired over a specific time period.” Often, this will help you
        compare different marketing approaches—for example, a Facebook
        campaign in the first week, a reddit campaign in the second, a Google
        AdWords campaign in the third, and a LinkedIn campaign in the fourth.
        Segmenting experiments by time in this way isn’t precise, but it’s
        relatively easy.<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.ch01fn04" id="ch01fn04">7</a>]</sup> And it’s actionable: if Facebook works better than
        LinkedIn, you know where to spend your money.</p><p>Actionable metrics aren’t magic. They won’t tell you what to
        do—in the previous example, you could try changing your pricing, or
        your medium, or your wording. The point here is that you’re doing
        <span class="emphasis"><em>something</em></span> based on the data you collect.</p></div><div class="sect1 pattern" title="Eight Vanity Metrics to Watch Out For"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="pattern_eight_vanity_metrics_to_watch_ou" style="clear: both">Eight Vanity Metrics to Watch Out For</h2></div></div></div><p>It’s easy to fall in love with numbers that go up and to the

              number. Count people instead.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Number of page views."><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Number of page

              counts the number of times someone requests a page. Unless your
              business model depends on page views (i.e., display advertising
              inventory), you should count people instead.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Number of visits."><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Number of

        money, or users, or lines of code. We <span class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> we
        don’t know the value of the metric, so we go find out. We may use
        these metrics for accounting (“How many widgets did we sell today?”)
        or to measure the outcome of an experiment (“Did the green or the red
        widget sell more?”), but in both cases, we know the metric is
        needed.</p><p>The “unknown unknowns” are most relevant to startups: exploring
        to discover something new that will help you disrupt a market. As
        we’ll see in the next case study, it’s how Circle of Friends found out
        that moms were its best users. These “unknown unknowns” are where the
        magic lives. They lead down plenty of wrong paths, and hopefully
        toward some kind of “eureka!” moment when the idea falls into place.
        This fits what Steve Blank says a startup should spend its time doing:
        searching for a scalable, repeatable business model.</p><p>Analytics has a role to play in all four of Rumsfeld’s

        allowed you to organize your friends into circles for targeted content
        sharing. Mike Greenfield and his co-founders started the company in
        September 2007, shortly after Facebook launched its developer
        platform. The timing was perfect: Facebook became an open, viral place
        to acquire users as quickly as possible and build a startup. There had
        never been a platform with so many users and that was so open
        (Facebook had about 50 million users at the time).</p><p>By mid-2008, Circle of Friends had 10 million users. Mike
        focused on growth above everything else. “It was a land grab,” he
        says, and Circle of Friends was clearly viral. But there was a
        problem. Too few people were actually <span class="emphasis"><em>using</em></span> the
        product.</p><p>According to Mike, less than 20% of circles had any activity
        whatsoever after their initial creation. “We had a few million monthly
        uniques from those 10 million users, but as a general social network
        we knew that wasn’t good enough and monetization would likely be
        poor.”</p><p>So Mike went digging.</p><p>He started looking through the database of users and what they
        were doing. The company didn’t have an in-depth analytical dashboard
        at the time, but Mike could still do some exploratory analysis. And he
        found a segment of users—moms, to be precise—that bucked the poor
        engagement trend of most users. Here’s what he found:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Their messages to one another were on average 50%
            longer.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They were 115% more likely to attach a picture to a post

            deep) conversation.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They had friends who, once invited, were 50% more likely to

        and his team switched focus completely. They pivoted. And in October
        2008, they launched Circle of Moms on Facebook.</p><p>Initially, numbers dropped as a result of the new focus, but by
        2009, the team grew its community to 4.5 million users—and unlike the
        users who’d been lost in the change, these were actively engaged. The
        company went through some ups and downs after that, as Facebook
        limited applications’ abilities to spread virally. Ultimately, the
        company moved off Facebook, grew independently, and sold to Sugar Inc.
        in early 2012.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Circle of Friends was a social graph application in the

        Learned</strong></span></p><p>The key to Mike’s success with Circle of Moms was his ability to
        dig into the data and look for meaningful patterns and opportunities.
        Mike discovered an “unknown unknown” that led to a big, scary, gutsy
        bet (drop the generalized Circle of Friends to focus on a specific
        niche) that was a gamble—but one that was based on data.</p><p>There’s a “critical mass” of engagement necessary for any
        community to take off. Mild success may not give you escape velocity.
        As a result, it’s better to have fervent engagement with a smaller,
        more easily addressable target market. Virality requires focus.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Leading Versus Lagging Metrics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="leading_versus_lagging_metrics" style="clear: both">Leading Versus Lagging Metrics</h2></div></div></div><p>Both leading and lagging metrics are useful, but they serve
        different purposes.</p><p>A leading metric (sometimes called a <span class="emphasis"><em>leading
        indicator</em></span>) tries to predict the future. For example, the
        current number of prospects in your sales funnel gives you a sense of
        how many new customers you’ll acquire in the future. <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1009"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1183"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1288"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1785"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1932"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1939"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1953"/>If the current number of prospects is very small, you’re
        not likely to add many new customers. You can increase the number of
        prospects and expect an increase in new customers.</p><p>On the other hand, a lagging metric, such as
        <span class="emphasis"><em>churn</em></span> (which is the number of customers who leave
        in a given time period) gives you an indication that there’s a
        problem—but by the time you’re able to collect the data and identify
        the problem, it’s too late. The customers who churned out aren’t
        coming back. That doesn’t mean you can’t act on a lagging metric
        (i.e., work to improve churn and then measure it again), but it’s akin
        to closing the barn door after the horses have left. New horses won’t
        leave, but you’ve already lost a few.</p><p>In the early days of your startup, you won’t have enough data to
        know how a current metric relates to one down the road, so measure
        lagging metrics at first. Lagging metrics are still useful and can
        provide a solid baseline of performance. For leading indicators to
        work, you need to be able to do cohort analysis and compare groups of
        customers over periods of time.</p><p>Consider, for example, the volume of customer complaints. You
        might track the number of support calls that happen in a day—once
        you’ve got a call volume to make that useful. Earlier on, you might
        track the number of customer complaints in a 90-day period. Both could
        be leading indicators of churn: if complaints are increasing, it’s
        likely that more customers will stop using your product or service. As
        a leading indicator, customer complaints also give you ammunition to
        dig into what’s going on, figure out why customers are complaining
        more, and address those issues.</p><p>Now consider account cancellation or product returns. Both are
        important metrics—but they measure after the fact. They pinpoint
        problems, but only after it’s too late to avert the loss of a
        customer. Churn is important (and we discuss it at length throughout
        the book), but looking at it myopically won’t let you iterate and
        adapt at the speed you need.</p><p>Indicators are everywhere. In an enterprise software company,
        quarterly new product bookings are a lagging metric of sales success.
        By contrast, new qualified leads are a leading indicator, because they
        let you predict sales success ahead of time. But as anyone who’s ever
        worked in B2B (business-to-business) sales will tell you, in addition
        to qualified leads you need a good understanding of conversion rate
        and sales-cycle length. Only then can you make a realistic estimate of
        how much new business you’ll book.</p><p>In some cases, a lagging metric for one group within a company
        is a leading metric for another. For example, we know that the number
        of quarterly bookings is a lagging metric for salespeople (the
        contracts are signed already), but for the finance department that’s
        focused on collecting <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1164"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1272"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1686"/>payment, they’re a leading indicator of expected revenue
        (since the revenue hasn’t yet been realized).</p><p>Ultimately, you need to decide whether the thing you’re tracking
        helps you make better decisions sooner. As we’ve said, a real metric
        has to be actionable. Lagging and leading metrics can both be
        actionable, but leading indicators show you what
        <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> happen, reducing your cycle time and making
        you leaner.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Correlated Versus Causal Metrics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="correlated_versus_causal_metrics" style="clear: both">Correlated Versus Causal Metrics</h2></div></div></div><p>In Canada, the use of winter tires is correlated with a decrease
        in accidents. People put softer winter tires on their cars in cold
        weather, and there are more accidents in the summer.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch01fn05" id="ch01fn05">8</a>]</sup> Does that mean we should make drivers use winter tires
        year-round? Almost certainly not—softer tires stop poorly on warm
        summer roads, and accidents would increase.</p><p>Other factors, such as the number of hours driven and summer
        vacations, are likely responsible for the increased accident rates.
        But looking at a simple correlation without demanding causality leads
        to some bad decisions. There’s a correlation between ice cream
        consumption and drowning. Does that mean we should ban ice cream to
        avert drowning deaths? Or measure ice cream consumption to predict the
        fortunes of funeral home stock prices? No: ice cream and drowning
        rates both happen <span class="emphasis"><em>because of</em></span> summer
        weather.</p><p>Finding a correlation between two metrics is a good thing.
        Correlations can help you predict what will happen. But finding the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>cause</em></span> of something means you can change it.
        Usually, causations aren’t simple one-to-one relationships. Many
        factors conspire to cause something. In the case of summertime car
        crashes, we have to consider alcohol consumption, the number of
        inexperienced drivers on the road, the greater number of daylight
        hours, summer vacations, and so on. So you’ll seldom get a 100% causal
        relationship. You’ll get several independent metrics, each of which
        “explains” a portion of the behavior of the dependent metric. But even
        a degree of causality is valuable.</p><p>You prove causality by finding a correlation, then running an
        experiment in which you control the other variables and measure the
        difference. This is hard to do because no two users are identical;
        it’s often impossible to subject a statistically significant number of
        people to a properly controlled experiment in the real world.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1464"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1702"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1756"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1773"/>If you have a big enough sample of users, you can run a
        reliable test without controlling all the other variables, because
        eventually the impact of the other variables is relatively
        unimportant. That’s why Google can test subtle factors like the color
        of a hyperlink,<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch01fn06" id="ch01fn06">9</a>]</sup> and why Microsoft knows exactly what effect a slower
        page load time has on search rates.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch01fn07" id="ch01fn07">10</a>]</sup> But for the average startup, you’ll need to run simpler
        tests that experiment with only a few things, and then compare how
        that changed the business.</p><p>We’ll look at different kinds of testing and segmentation
        shortly, but for now, recognize this: correlation is good. Causality
        is great. Sometimes, you may have to settle for the former—but you
        should always be trying to discover the latter.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Moving Targets"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="moving_targets" style="clear: both">Moving Targets</h2></div></div></div><p>When picking a goal early on, you’re drawing a line in the
        sand—not carving it in stone. You’re chasing a moving target, because
        you really don’t know how to define success.</p><p>Adjusting your goals and how you define your key metrics is
        acceptable, provided that you’re being honest with yourself,
        recognizing the change this means for your business, and not just
        lowering expectations so that you can keep going in spite of the
        evidence.</p><p>When your initial offering—your minimum viable product—is in the
        market and you’re acquiring early-adopter customers and testing their
        use of your product, you won’t even know how they’re going to use it
        (although you’ll have assumptions). Sometimes there’s a huge gulf
        between what you assume and what users actually do. You might think
        that people will play your multiplayer game, only to discover that
        they’re using you as a photo upload service. Unlikely? That’s how
        Flickr got started.</p><p>Sometimes, however, the differences are subtler. You might
        assume your product has to be used daily to succeed, only to find out
        that’s not so. In these situations, it’s reasonable to update your
        metrics accordingly, provided that you’re able to prove the value
        created.</p></div><div class="sect1 case_study" title="HighScore House Defines an “Active User”"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_highscore_house_defines_an_qu" style="clear: both">HighScore House Defines an “Active User”</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1524"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1768"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2060"/>HighScore House started as a simple application that
        allowed parents to list chores and challenges for their children with
        point values. Kids could complete the tasks, collect points, and
        redeem the points for rewards they wanted.</p><p>When HighScore House launched its MVP, the company had several
        hundred families ready to test it. The founders drew a line in the
        sand: in order for the MVP to be considered successful, parents and
        kids would have to each use the application four times per week. These
        families would be considered “active.” It was a high, but good,
        bar.</p><p>After a month or so, the percentage of active families was lower
        than this line in the sand. The founders were disappointed but
        determined to keep experimenting in an effort to improve
        engagement:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>They modified the sign-up flow (making it clearer and more
            educational to increase quality signups and to improve
            onboarding).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They sent email notifications as daily reminders to
            parents.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They sent transactional emails to parents based on actions
            their kids took in the system.</p></li></ul></div><p>There was an incremental improvement each time, but nothing that
        moved the needle significantly enough to say that the MVP was a
        success.</p><p>Then co-founder and CEO Kyle Seaman did something critical:
        <span class="emphasis"><em>he picked up the phone</em></span>. Kyle spoke with dozens of
        parents. He started calling parents who had signed up, but who weren’t
        active. First he reached out to those that had abandoned HighScore
        House completely (“churned out”). For many of them, the application
        wasn’t solving a big enough pain point. That’s fine. The founders
        never assumed the market was “all parents”—that’s just too broad a
        definition, particularly for a first version of a product. Kyle was
        looking for a smaller subset of families where HighScore House would
        resonate, to narrow the market segment and focus.</p><p>Kyle then called those families who <span class="emphasis"><em>were</em></span>
        using HighScore House, but not using it enough to be defined as
        active. Many of these families responded positively: “We’re using
        HighScore House. It’s great. The kids are making their beds
        consistently for the first time ever!”</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2074"/>The response from parents was a surprise. Many of them
        were using HighScore House only once or twice a week, but they were
        getting value out of the product. From this, Kyle learned about
        segmentation and which types of families were more or less interested
        in what the company was offering. He began to understand that the
        initial baseline of usage the team had set wasn’t consistent with how
        engaged customers were using the product.</p><p>That doesn’t mean the team shouldn’t have taken a guess. Without
        that initial line in the sand, they would have had no benchmark for
        learning, and Kyle might not have picked up the phone. But now he
        really understood his customers. The combination of quantitative and
        qualitative data was key.</p><p>As a result of this learning, the team redefined the “active
        user” threshold to more accurately reflect existing users’ behavior.
        It was okay for them to adjust a key metric because they truly
        understood why they were doing it and could justify the change.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>HighScore House drew an early, audacious line in the

        with customers and users directly. All the numbers in the world can’t
        explain why something is happening. Pick up the phone right now and
        call a customer, even one who’s disengaged.</p><p>Second, make early assumptions and set targets for what you
        think success looks like, but don’t experiment yourself into oblivion.
        Lower the bar if necessary, but not for the sake of getting over it:
        that’s just cheating. Use qualitative data to understand what value
        you’re creating and adjust only if the new line in the sand reflects
        how customers (in specific segments) are using your product.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Segments, Cohorts, A/B Testing, and Multivariate Analysis"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="segmentscomma_cohortscomma_asolidusb_tes" style="clear: both">Segments, Cohorts, A/B Testing, and Multivariate

        usually involves comparing two things against each other through
        segmentation, cohort analysis, or A/B testing. These are important
        concepts for anyone trying to perform the kind of scientific
        comparison needed to justify a change, so we’ll explain them in some
        detail here.</p><div class="sect2" title="Segmentation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="segmentation">Segmentation</h3></div></div></div><p>A segment is simply a group that shares some common
          characteristic. It might be users who run Firefox, or restaurant
          patrons who make reservations rather than walking in, or passengers
          who buy first-class tickets, or parents who drive minivans.</p><p>On websites, you segment visitors according to a range of
          technical and demographic information, then compare one segment to
          another. If visitors using the Firefox browser have significantly
          fewer purchases, do additional testing to find out why. If a
          disproportionate number of engaged users are coming from Australia,
          survey them to discover why, and then try to replicate that success
          in other markets.</p><p>Segmentation works for any industry and any form of marketing,
          not just for websites. Direct mail marketers have been segmenting
          for decades with great success.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Cohort Analysis"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="cohort_analysis">Cohort Analysis</h3></div></div></div><p>A second kind of analysis, which compares similar groups over
          time, is cohort analysis. As you build and test your product, you’ll
          iterate constantly. Users who join you in the first week will have a
          different experience from those who join later on. For example, all
          of your users might go through an initial free trial, usage,
          payment, and abandonment cycle. As this happens, you’ll make changes
          to your business model. The users who experienced the trial in month
          one will have a different onboarding experience from those who
          experience it in month five. How did that affect their churn? To

          across their lifecycle. You can compare cohorts against one another

          perspective. In this example, poor monetization in early months was
          diluting the overall health of the metrics. The January cohort—the
          first row—spent $5 in its first month, then tapered off to only
          $0.50 in its fifth month. But first-month spending is growing
          dramatically, and the drop-off seems better, too: April’s cohort
          spent $8 in its first month and $7 in its second month. A company
          that seemed stalled is in fact flourishing. And you know what metric
          to focus on: drop-off in sales after the first month.</p><p>This kind of reporting allows you to see patterns clearly
          against the lifecycle of a customer, rather than slicing across all
          customers blindly without accounting for the natural cycle a
          customer undergoes. Cohort analysis can be done for revenue, churn,
          viral word of mouth, support costs, or any other metric you care

          best to focus on the critical steps and assumptions. The results can
          pay off dramatically: Jay Parmar, co-founder of crowdfunded
          ticketing site Picatic, told us that simply changing the company’s
          call to action from “Get started free” to “Try it out free”
          increased the number of people who clicked on an offer—known as the
          <span class="emphasis"><em>click-through rate</em></span>—by 376% for a 10-day
          period.</p><p>A/B tests seem relatively simple, but they have a problem.
          Unless you’re a huge web property—like Bing or Google—with enough
          traffic to run a test on a single factor like link color or page
          speed and get an answer quickly, you’ll have more things to test
          than you have traffic. You might want to test the color of a web
          page, the text in a call to action, and the picture you’re showing
          to visitors.</p><p>Rather than running a series of separate tests one after the
          other—which will delay your learning cycle—you can analyze them all
          at once using a technique called <span class="emphasis"><em>multivariate
