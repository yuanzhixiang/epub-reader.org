      see. They often use the pivot as an enabler for chronic ADD, rather than
      as a way to iterate through ideas in a methodical fashion.</p><p>But one of the keys to startup success is achieving real focus and
      having the discipline to maintain it. You may succeed if you’re
      unfocused, but it’ll be by accident. You’ll spend a lot more time
      wandering aimlessly, and the lessons learned are more painful and
      harder-won. If there’s any secret to success for a startup, it’s
      focus.</p><p>Focus doesn’t mean myopia. We’re not saying that there’s only one
      metric you care about from the day you wake up with an idea to the day
      you sell your company. We are, however, saying that at any given time,
      there’s one metric you should care about above all else. Boiled down to
      its very essence, Lean Startup is really about getting you to focus on
      the right thing, at the right time, with the right mindset.</p><p>As noted in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Analytics Frameworks">Chapter 5</a>, Eric Ries
      talks about three engines that drive company growth: the sticky engine,
      the viral engine, and the paid engine. But he cautions that while all
      successful companies will ultimately use all three engines, it’s better
      to focus on one engine at a time. For example, you might make your
      product sticky for its core users, then use that to grow virally, and
      then use the user base to grow revenue. That’s focus.</p><p>In the world of analytics and data, this means picking a single
      metric that’s incredibly important for the step you’re currently working
      through in your startup. We call this the One Metric That Matters
      (OMTM).</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1227"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1462"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1591"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1637"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1835"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2079"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2212"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2274"/>The OMTM is the one number you’re completely focused on
      above everything else for your current stage. Looking at CLV (customer
      lifetime value) isn’t meaningful when you’re validating a problem, but
      it might be the right metric to focus on as you’re approaching
      product/market fit.</p><p>You’ll always track and review multiple numbers. Some will be
      important: these are your key performance indicators (KPIs), which
      you’ll track and report every day. Others will be stored away for future
      use, such as when it’s time to tell the company history to an investor
      or to make an infographic. Setting up and managing instrumentation is
      fairly easy these days with tools like Geckoboard, Mixpanel,
      Kissmetrics, Totango, Chartbeat, and others. But don’t let your ability
      to track so many things distract you. <span class="emphasis"><em>Capture everything, but

        <span class="emphasis"><em>Software as a Service</em></span> (SaaS) vendor that helps
        companies monitor and improve their websites’ search engine rankings.
        In May 2012, the company raised $18 million. Its CEO, Rand Fishkin,
        published a detailed post about the company’s progress up to that
        point.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch06fn01" id="ch06fn01">19</a>]</sup> Rand’s update did include a number of vanity
        metrics—when you have roughly 15 million visitors on your site each
        year, you have the right to a bit of vanity—but he also shared some
        very specific and interesting numbers related to conversions from free
        trials to paid subscriptions and churn.</p><p>We spoke with Joanna Lord, Vice President of Growth Marketing at
        Moz, to learn more about how the company handles metrics. “We are very
        metrics-driven,” she says. “Every team reports to the entire company
        weekly on KPIs, movement, and summaries. We also have a huge screen up
        in the office pumping out customer counts and free trial counts. We
        believe that having company-wide transparency into the metrics keeps
        us all informed, and is a great reminder of the progress (as well as
        the challenges) we are seeing as a company.”</p><p>For a company that’s found product/market fit and is now focused
        on scaling, it becomes more challenging to focus on a single metric.
        This isn’t surprising; there are multiple departments all growing
        quickly, and the business can tackle several different things
        simultaneously. But even with all these concurrent efforts, Joanna
        says that one metric <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1458"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1590"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1779"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1833"/>stands above the rest: <span class="emphasis"><em>Net Adds</em></span>.
        This metric is the total of new paid subscribers (either conversions
        from free trials or direct paid signups) minus the total who
        cancelled.</p><p>“Net Adds helps us quickly see high cancel days (and
        troubleshoot them) and helps us get a sense of how our free trial
        conversion rate is doing,” Joanna says.</p><p>Moz tracks other related metrics including Total Paying, New
        Free Trials Yesterday, and 7-Day Net Add Average. All of these really
        bubble up into Net Adds per day.</p><p>Interestingly, when Moz raised its last round of financing, one
        of its lead investors, the Foundry Group’s Brad Feld, suggested that
        it track fewer KPIs. “The main reason for this is that as a company,
        you can’t simultaneously affect dozens of KPIs,” Joanna says. “Brad
        reminded us that ‘too much data’ can be counterproductive. You can get
        lost in strange trends on numbers that aren’t as big-picture as
        others. You can also lose a lot of time reporting and communicating
        about numbers that might not lead to action. By stripping our daily
        KPI reporting down to just a few metrics, it’s clear what we’re
        focused on as a company and how we’re doing.”</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Moz is metrics-driven—but that doesn’t mean it’s swimming in

        assumptions rely is the best way to get the entire organization moving
        in the same direction.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Four Reasons to Use the One Metric That Matters"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="four_reasons_to_use_the_one_metric_that" style="clear: both">Four Reasons to Use the One Metric That Matters</h2></div></div></div><p>The OMTM is of most importance early on. Later, as your startup
        scales, you will want to focus on more metrics, and you’ll have the
        resources and experience to do so. Importantly, you’ll also have a
        team to whom you can delegate metrics. Your operations person might
        care about uptime or latency, your call center might worry about
        average time on hold, and so on.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2343"/>At Year One Labs, one of the litmus tests for us as
        advisors and investors was the clarity with which a team understood,
        and tracked, their OMTM. If it was on the tip of their tongues, and
        aligned with their current stage, that was a good thing. If they
        didn’t know what it was, if it was the wrong metric for their stage,
        if they had several metrics, or if they didn’t know what the current
        value was, we knew something was wrong.</p><p>Picking the OMTM lets you run more controlled experiments
        quickly and compare the results more effectively. Remember: the One
        Metric That Matters changes over time. When you’re focused on
        acquiring users (and converting them into customers), your OMTM may be
        tied to which acquisition channels are working best or the conversion
        rate from signup to active user. When you’re focused on retention, you
        may be looking at churn, and experimenting with pricing, features,
        improving customer support, and so on. The OMTM changes depending on
        your current stage, and in some cases it will change quickly.</p><p>Let’s look at four reasons why you should use the One Metric
        That Matters.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>It answers the most important
            question you have.</strong></span> At any given time, you’ll be trying
            to answer a hundred different questions and juggling a million
            things. You need to identify the riskiest areas of your business
            as quickly as possible, and that’s where the most important
            question lies. When you know what the right question is, you’ll
            know what metric to track in order to answer that question. That’s
            the OMTM.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>It forces you to draw a line in the
            sand</strong></span> and have clear goals. After you’ve identified the
            key problem on which you want to focus, you need to set goals. You
            need a way of defining success.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>It focuses the entire
            company.</strong></span> Avinash Kaushik has a name for trying to
            report too many things: data puking.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch06fn02" id="ch06fn02">20</a>]</sup> Nobody likes puke. Use the OMTM as a way of focusing
            your entire company. Display your OMTM prominently through web
            dashboards, on TV screens, or in regular emails.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>It inspires a culture of
            experimentation.</strong></span> By now you should appreciate the
            importance of experimentation. It’s critical to move through the
            <span class="emphasis"><em>build</em></span>→<span class="emphasis"><em>measure</em></span>→<span class="emphasis"><em>learn</em></span>
            cycle as quickly and as frequently as possible. To succeed at
            that, you need to actively encourage experimentation. It will lead
            to small-<span class="emphasis"><em>f</em></span> failures, but you can’t punish
            that. Quite the opposite: failure that comes from planned,
            methodical testing is simply how you learn. It moves things
            forward in the end. It’s how you avoid <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1836"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2108"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2109"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2118"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2131"/>big-<span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> Failure. Everyone in your
            organization should be inspired and encouraged to experiment. When
            everyone rallies around the OMTM and is given the opportunity to
            experiment independently to improve it, it’s a powerful
            force.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect1 case_study" title="Solare Focuses on a Few Key Metrics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_solare_focuses_on_a_few_key_m" style="clear: both">Solare Focuses on a Few Key Metrics</h2></div></div></div><p>Solare Ristorante is an Italian restaurant in San Diego owned by
        serial entrepreneur Randy Smerik. Randy has a background in technology
        and data, once served as the general manager for business intelligence
        firm Teradata, and has five technology exits under his belt. It’s no
        surprise that he’s brought his data-driven mindset to the way he runs
        the business.</p><p>One evening at the restaurant, Randy’s son Tommy—who manages the
        bar—yelled out, “24!” Since we’re always looking for stories about
        business metrics, we asked him what the number meant. “Every day, my
        staff tells me the ratio of staff costs to gross revenues for the
        previous day,” he explained. “This is a fairly well-known number in
        the restaurant industry. It’s useful because it combines two things
        you have a degree of control over—per-diner revenues and staffing
        costs.”</p><p>Randy explained when staffing costs exceed 30% of gross
        revenues, that’s bad, because it means that you’re either spending too
        much on staff or not deriving enough revenue per customer. A
        Michelin-starred restaurant can afford to have more staff, and pay
        them more, because it sells customers expensive wines and enjoys good
        per-customer revenue. At the other end of the spectrum, a low-margin
        casual dining restaurant has to keep staff costs down.</p><p>The ratio works because it’s:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p title="Simple:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Simple:</strong></span></strong></span> It’s a single number.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Immediate:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Immediate:</strong></span></strong></span> You can generate it every night.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Actionable:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Actionable:</strong></span></strong></span> You can change staffing, or encourage upselling, the very
              next day, whereas ingredient costs, menus, or leasing take
              longer to modify.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Comparable:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Comparable:</strong></span></strong></span> You can track it over time, and compare it to other
              restaurants in your category.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Fundamental:"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Fundamental:</strong></span></strong></span> It reflects two basic facets of the restaurant business
              model.</p></li></ul></div><p>As it turns out, 24% is about right. Below 20%, there’s a chance
        that you’re under-serving customers and that their dining experience
        might <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1831"/>suffer (Randy could experiment with different staffing
        levels and measure the tips diners leave, or comments on Yelp, if he
        wanted to be really analytical).</p><p>Randy also uses a second metric to predict how many customers
        he’ll have. At 5 p.m. every day, his staff sends him the number of
        reservations that have currently been made for the evening. “If I get
        50 reservations at 5 p.m., I know I’ll have around 250 covers that
        night,” he says. “We’ve learned that a 5-to-1 ratio is normal for
        Solare.”</p><p>This number doesn’t work across all restaurants—the in-demand
        Michelin-starred restaurant has a 1-to-1 ratio, since it’s sold out,
        and a fast food restaurant that doesn’t take reservations obviously
        can’t use the metric. But for Solare reservations at 5 p.m., plus some
        experience, provides a good leading indicator of what the night will
        be like. It also allows the Solare team to make small adjustments to
        staffing or buy additional produce in time to ensure that the
        restaurant can handle the traffic.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Restaurants know from experience that demand is tied to
            reservations, and what the right ratio of staffing to revenue
            should be.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Good metrics help predict the future, giving you an
            opportunity to anticipate problems and correct them.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Analytics Lessons

        that relate to their core business model, then track them over time to
        predict what’s going to happen and identify patterns or trends.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Drawing Lines in the Sand"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="drawing_lines_in_the_sand" style="clear: both">Drawing Lines in the Sand</h2></div></div></div><p>Knowing which metric to focus on isn’t enough. You need to draw
        a line in the sand as well. Let’s say that you’ve decided “New
        Customers Per Week” is the right metric to focus on because you’re
        testing out new ways of acquiring customers. That’s fair, but it
        doesn’t answer the real question: <span class="emphasis"><em>How many new customers per
        week do you need?</em></span> Or more specifically: <span class="emphasis"><em>How many
        new customers per week (per acquisition channel) do you think defines
        a level of success that enables you to double down on user acquisition
        and move to the next step in the process?</em></span></p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1837"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2130"/>You need to pick a number, set it as the target, and
        have enough confidence that if you hit it, you consider it success.
        And if you don’t hit the target, you need to go back to the drawing
        board and try again.</p><p>Picking the target number for any given metric is extremely
        hard. We’ve seen many startups struggle with this. Often, they avoid
        picking a number altogether. Unfortunately, this means it’s difficult
        to know what to do once an experiment is completed. If, in our
        example, the user acquisition experiment is a dismal failure, any
        number you had picked beforehand is probably immaterial; you’ll know
        it’s a failure. And if your efforts are insanely successful, you’re
        going to know that as well. It’ll be obvious. But most of the time,
        experiments end up right in the big fat middle. There was some
        success, but it wasn’t out of this world. Was it enough success to
        keep going, or do you have to go back and run some new experiments?
        That’s the trickiest spot to be in.</p><p>There are two right answers to the question of what success
        looks like. The first comes from your business model, which may tell
        you what a metric has to be. If you know that you need 10% of your
        users to sign up for the paid version of your site in order to meet
        your business targets, then that’s your number.</p><p>In the early stages of your business, however, you’re still
        figuring out what your business model should look like. It won’t tell
        you precisely what you need. The second right answer is to look at
        what’s normal or ideal. Knowing an industry baseline means you know
        what’s likely to happen, and you can compare yourself to it. In the
        absence of any other information, this is a good place to start. We’ll
        share some industry benchmarks that may be helpful to you later in the
        book.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The Squeeze Toy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="squeeze_toy" style="clear: both">The Squeeze Toy</h2></div></div></div><p>There’s another important aspect to the OMTM. And we can’t
        really explain it better than with a squeeze toy.</p><p>If you optimize your business to maximize one metric, something
        important happens. Just like one of those bulging stress-relief
        squeeze toys, squeezing it in one place makes it bulge out in another.
        And that’s a good thing. Optimizing your OMTM not only squeezes that
        metric so you get the most out of it, but it also reveals the next
        place you need to focus your efforts, which often happens at an
        inflection point for your business:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Perhaps you’ve optimized the number of enrollments in your
            gym, and you’ve done all you can to maximize revenues—but now you
            need to focus on cost per customer so you turn a profit.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1829"/>Maybe you’ve increased traffic to your site—but now
