      realized it needed a way to counteract German advances in
      aviation—specifically, jet aircraft. The US military asked Lockheed
      Martin (then the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation) to build a jet fighter.
      Desperate times called for desperate measures: in a month, the
      engineering team had a proposal. Less than six months later, working in
      a closely guarded circus tent, they built the first plane.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch30fn01" id="ch30fn01">151</a>]</sup></p><p>This group became known as the Skunk Works, a title that’s
      synonymous with an independent, autonomous group charged with innovation
      inside a bigger, slower-moving organization. Such groups are often
      immune to the restrictions and budget oversight that guides the rest of
      the company, and have the specific goal of working “out of the box” to
      mitigate the inertia of large businesses. Companies like Google and
      Apple adopt this same approach, creating their own advanced research
      groups such as the Google X Lab.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch30fn02" id="ch30fn02">152</a>]</sup></p><p>Making things change quickly is hard, and if you’re going to do
      it, you need authority commensurate with responsibility. If you’re

        organizational chart to an enterprising general superintendent of the
        railroad era named Daniel C. McCallum.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch30fn03" id="ch30fn03">153</a>]</sup> In the 1850s, railroads were a booming business.
        Unfortunately for investors, they didn’t scale well. Small railroads
        turned a profit; big ones didn’t.</p><p>McCallum noticed this, and divided his railroad into smaller
        sections, each run by subordinates who reported back a standard set of
        information he defined. McCallum’s line—as well as other lines that
        copied this approach—thrived. McCallum’s model, inspired by his time
        as a soldier and the regimented hierarchies he had learned in the
        military, was then applied to other industries.</p><p>McCallum was the first management scientist, introducing
        controls, structure, and regulations in order to reduce risk and
        increase predictability at scale. Unfortunately, intrapreneurs aren’t
        trying to solve for safety and predictability. Their job is to
        <span class="emphasis"><em>take</em></span> risks, and to uncover the non-obvious and
        the unpredictable. If you’re trying to provoke change and disrupt the
        status quo, then the organizations McCallum introduced are your
        kryptonite. You need to shield yourself, just as the engineers within
        the Skunk Works did decades ago. But you also need to coexist with the
        organization, because unlike an independent startup, the fruits of
        your labors must integrate with your host company.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>What you make may <span class="strong"><strong>cannibalize the

        to change. If you have both, even a huge company can move quickly. In
        the late 90s, as the web browser grew in importance, analysts were
        predicting the downfall of Microsoft, but they underestimated Bill
        Gates’s ability to turn his company quickly. Within a few months, the
        company had created Internet Explorer and insinuated it throughout its
        Windows operating system: you’d type a URL, and it would convert it to
        a hyperlink. You’d save something, and it would have an HTML version.
        Even the much-maligned paperclip knew about the Web.</p><p>While Microsoft did have to contend with antitrust accusations,
        its quick response staved off irrelevance and kneecapped ascendant
        Netscape. Jim Clark, Netscape’s CEO, called Gates’s response ruthless,
        but noted that his ruthlessness came from the company’s dominance in
        the desktop space. “In order to be ruthless you have to have some kind
        of power, and in most cases I’ve been going up against Microsoft, so I
        never had that power.”<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch30fn09" id="ch30fn09">159</a>]</sup></p><p>Since that time, the company has had to do the same with its
        Office suite. In 2005, Gates and Ray Ozzie announced the shift from a
        licensed software package to a hosted, SaaS-based offering.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch30fn10" id="ch30fn10">160</a>]</sup> This time, the threat was from Google’s nascent office
        offering, which would be subsidized by Google’s money-making ad
        machine. While Google’s product was just a gleam in its <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1093"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1113"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1162"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1551"/>founders’ eyes, services like Write.ly made it plain
        that desktop productivity suites were under siege.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch30fn11" id="ch30fn11">161</a>]</sup></p><p>Critics of Microsoft’s reactions complain that the company isn’t
        changing; rather, it’s managing to stay the same and exert its
        dominance, avoiding or delaying market change. “I realized that
        Microsoft had not turned at all,” said Dave Winer in 1999. “What’s
        actually been happening is that Microsoft is exerting tremendous
        energy to stay right where it is.”<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch30fn12" id="ch30fn12">162</a>]</sup></p><p>As an intrapreneur, you might find that this “innovate to stay
        still” notion does not sit well with you. You’re a disruptor, right?
        However, when you’re working for an incumbent with large market share,
        sometimes innovation is about maintaining a company’s dominance and
        suppressing change to continue making money in the traditional ways.
        If you don’t like that, you should probably leave the company and
        start something of your own.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Stars, Dogs, Cows, and Question Marks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="starscomma_dogscomma_cowscomma_and_quest" style="clear: both">Stars, Dogs, Cows, and Question Marks</h2></div></div></div><p>Why might you not want to disrupt things? To understand this,
        you need to look at how large organizations plan their product and
        market strategy.</p><p>The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) box, shown in <a class="xref" href="ch30.html#bcg_box_ever_wonder_where_quotation_mark" title="Figure 30-1. The BCG box: ever wonder where “cash cows” came from?">Figure 30-1</a>, is a simple way
        to think about a company’s product portfolio. It classifies products
        or subsidiaries according to two dimensions: how quickly the market is
        growing, and how big a market share the company has in that
        market.</p><p>Products with high market share but slow growth are “cash cows.”
        They generate revenue, but they aren’t worthy of heavy investment. By
        contrast, products with high growth but small market share are
        “question marks,” candidates for investment and development. Those
        with both growth and market share are the rising “stars.” Those with
        neither—called “dogs”—are to be sold off or shut down.</p><p>The BCG box offers a thumbnail of a company’s product portfolio.
        It’s also a good way to think about innovation. If you’re trying to
        change a company, you’re either trying to create a new product
        (hopefully in a growing market) or you’re trying to innovate to
        revitalize an existing product with the addition of new features,
        markets, or services.</p><div class="figure"><a id="bcg_box_ever_wonder_where_quotation_mark"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00067"/><img alt="The BCG box: ever wonder where “cash cows” came from?" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989334.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 30-1. The BCG box: ever wonder where “cash cows” came from?</div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1538"/>Seen from a Lean Startup perspective, the BCG box shows
        us what stage we’re working on and what metrics should apply. If
        you’re creating new products or companies (question marks), then you
        need to focus on empathy. If you’re trying to rescue a dog, you still
        need empathy, and you have access to existing customers. You’re either
        going to change the product (to enter an area of increased growth) or
        the market (to gain market share).</p><p>If you have a question mark (high growth but nascent market
        share), you’ll be focusing on growing market share through organic
        (virality) or inorganic (customer acquisition) means.</p><p>If you have a star, and the market’s growth is stalling, you
        need to optimize revenues and reduce costs so your marginal cost of
        product delivery is healthy. That way you can survive the coming
        commoditization and price wars. On the other hand, if there’s a
        disruption in the industry that might expand the market—such as the
        rise of mobile technology, or the emergence of international
        demand—you’ll be focusing on increasing growth rate to return a cash
        cow to star status.</p><p>Companies tend to try to improve what they have, which is one of

        flavor, then asked customers to name it.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch30fn17" id="ch30fn17">167</a>]</sup> In later years, the company asked customers to choose
        which flavor it should add to its product line, literally labeling two
        new flavors A and B, and then testing them.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch30fn18" id="ch30fn18">168</a>]</sup> It also asked customers to help write the end of a TV ad
        that would be <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1434"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1555"/>broadcast during the Superbowl, giving them access to
        creative teams at its advertising agency.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch30fn19" id="ch30fn19">169</a>]</sup></p><p>This work required changes to distribution channels, from retail
        shelf space to the inclusion of temporary inventory. But the campaign
        worked—the company dominated social media. It had 1.5M visitors to its
        YouTube channel, and over 500,000 votes were cast by customers. It
        also found a way to iterate at scale, and do market development
        alongside brand building.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>An established distribution system in the consumer

        absolutely clear what kind of change you’re trying to produce, how
        you’ll measure progress toward that change, what resources you’ll have
        access to, and what rules you’ll be subject to. This might seem overly
        “corporate” for a mercenary looking to blow up the status quo, but in
        a big organization it’s simple reality.</p><p>If you don’t like it, go start your own company. If you want to
        work within the system, the change you’re after has to dovetail with
        the change the organization is ready for. This is why executive
        sponsorship is so important: it’s the difference between a “rogue
        agent” and a “special operative.”</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1116"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1364"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1554"/>Existing businesses are different largely because they
        already exist. Innovators can go rogue asking for forgiveness rather
        than permission—but the immune system of the host company may reject
        them. Ultimately, companies need to restructure themselves for a
        continuous cycle of innovation, but the way to get them to do so may
        involve baby steps—smaller, more controlled attempts at analytics.
        That’s the approach David Boyle used at EMI Music as he worked to
        introduce a data-driven culture.</p></div><div class="sect1 case_study" title="EMI Embraces Data to Understand Its Customers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_emi_embraces_data_to_understa" style="clear: both">EMI Embraces Data to Understand Its Customers</h2></div></div></div><p>David Boyle is the Senior Vice President of Insight at EMI
        Music, one of the major labels in the recording industry. His job is
        to help EMI make decisions based on data, and to help the company
        navigate the choppy waters of an industry in transition.</p><p>To get the company more focused on data and analytics, and less
        concerned with anecdotes and opinions, Boyle first had to choose which
        decisions needed to be made, then find ways to get the right evidence
        in front of the decision makers.</p><p>“The decisions we ultimately focused on were, ‘Which types of
        consumers should I try to connect an artist’s music to in which
        countries?’ and ‘What kinds of marketing should I do to try to reach
        those consumers?’ Most of that data came from consumer
        research.”</p><p>Boyle wasn’t short on data. EMI has billions of transaction
        records from digital services, as well as usage logs from artist
        websites and applications. “But each of these data sources is very
        limited in scope and very skewed concerning the types of person that
        is represented in that data set,” Boyle explained. So EMI built its
        own survey tool. “We found that building our own data set based on
        asking people questions and playing them music was the way to go.” The
        result was over 1 million detailed interviews, and hundreds of
        millions of data points.</p><p>“Bad data is a pain to sell to people. And even good data is a
        pain to sell to someone if it doesn’t actually help someone, whether
        that’s because it’s not in a form that helps them work out what to do
        or because it doesn’t actually answer the questions they are asking,”
        he says. “But when the data’s good and it really does help someone,
        then nobody can refuse it.”</p><p>Many intrapreneurs talk about the friction they face when trying
        to create a data-driven culture in their organizations, but Boyle is
        quick to caution against calling it resistance. “One of the key things
        we realized early on was that it’s not helpful to think of it as
        resistance. When you realize that the ‘resistance’ is actually good
        people who deeply care about the artists and music they are working
        with, trying to protect them from bad data or bad recommendations,
        then you see the whole thing differently.”</p><p>“If you really believe in the data and the recommendations that
        the data makes, then you focus on why the person doesn’t understand
        the data and you help them to understand it,” he explained. “When they
        understand, then their eyes light up, and they become a bigger fan of
        the data than I am!”</p><p>Despite his success with EMI, Boyle admits there are real
        differences between a startup and a big company. “In a startup, you
        have the benefits of starting off as you mean to go on: you can shape
        the way of thinking and behaving to, for example, incorporate data in
        decision making right from the start. That’s a great advantage over
        working in a business where the culture is already set.” But the
        startup world isn’t perfect, he says. “A startup has another big
        problem: intense pressure to deliver quickly. I’ve actually noticed
        that this can get in the way of things like building the right culture
        if you’re not careful.”</p><p>To build support and report progress within EMI, Boyle used case
        studies.</p><p>“We got lots of people who’d successfully used our data to help
        their artists tell their story. They were better and more creative
        than anything we could have organized centrally to spread the word.”
        EMI’s new data helped align particular artists with demographics to
        whom they’d appeal, allowing the music to reach the most receptive
        audiences.</p><p>Boyle didn’t tie the results of research to hard numbers. “We
        simply said: ‘Asking thousands of people what they think about
        something is better than not asking them, right?’ and we showed that
        we could do so at high quality and low cost, and we went for it. After
        the first set of data came back, people fell in love with it: it
        helped them and they loved that.”</p><p>Initially, the newly acquired research data helped EMI to
        understand the market and the ecosystem in which artists, music, and
        digital services exist. But now that the company has that context, it
        can revisit the billions of transactional records it collected in the
        past. “If we’d looked at that without first understanding the context
        in which it sits, we would have taken our artists in the wrong
        direction,” Boyle said.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1559"/>The project has grown beyond the initial insight team,
        and now it’s owned by the overall business at EMI. In the end, because
        everyone had access to data, the entire organization bought into the
        change. But what surprised Boyle the most was how valuable the
        (relatively small) consumer research continued to be, even though the
        organization could use the Big Data hoard from billions of
        transactions. “Good data beats big data,” he concludes. “I am
        constantly surprised at how good it can be when done properly.”</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>EMI had a huge amount of data, and little idea of how to use

        collected to solve a specific issue can help make the case for using
        data elsewhere in the organization. It’s also more likely to get
        executive sponsorship because the problem is bounded and constrained,
        whereas nobody knows what controversies are lurking in the larger
        amounts of “data exhaust” the organization has collected over the
        years.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The Stages of Intrapreneur Lean Analytics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="stages_of_intrapreneur_lean_analytics" style="clear: both">The Stages of Intrapreneur Lean Analytics</h2></div></div></div><p>If you’re a pioneering intrapreneur, you’ll go through a series
        of stages that maps closely to the stages we’ve seen in other startup
        models. But you have a few important steps to consider, as <a class="xref" href="ch30.html#intrapreneurs_need_an_extra_step_get_an" title="Figure 30-2. Intrapreneurs need an extra step: get an executive sponsor first">Figure 30-2</a> illustrates. Note

          executive buy-in. This may be implicit if it’s your job to try to
          find new opportunities, but even then, once you think you’ve found
          an opportunity, you need explicit approval from an executive. You
          want to know where you are on the BCG box, and where you’re trying
          to go, and you need to know what metrics your progress will be
          judged by. You need to know what resources you have, and what rules
          apply to you. This is like a prenuptial agreement: it’s better
          signed before the wedding.</p><p>At this stage, you’re defining your analytical strategy, and
          the lines in the sand against which you’ll be judged. These may be
          goals for the whole company, such as margins, or they may be a
          growth rate that’s considered success. You’ll also need to define
          how you will adjust these metrics based on what you learn.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Empathy: Find Problems, Don’t Test Demand"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="empathy_find_problemscomma_donapostrophe">Empathy: Find Problems, Don’t Test Demand</h3></div></div></div><p>Once you start doing customer development, remember that
          you’re testing problems and solutions—not existing demand. If you’re
          truly disruptive, customers won’t tell you what they want, but they
          <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> tell you why they <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1046"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1556"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1897"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2148"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2351"/>want it. In 2008, Swiffer creator Gianfranco Zaccai
          explained, “Successful business innovation isn’t about giving
          consumers what they need now, but about giving them something
          they’ll desire in the future.”<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch30fn20" id="ch30fn20">170</a>]</sup></p><p>Customers weren’t telling Netflix they wanted to stream
          videos, but their patterns of usage, computer adoption, broadband
          deployment, and browsing told the company a need existed.</p><p>This is a place for qualitative interviews. You should talk to
          existing users and customers, of course. But if you’re trying to
          grow market share, you’ll also want to talk to your competitors’
          customers, to distributors, and to everyone involved in purchasing
          the product. If you’re trying to improve growth rate, you’ll talk to
          adjacent customers. That’s what Bombardier did when it expanded from
          snowmobiles to personal watercraft (despite an initial, failed 1960s
          foray into the industry that was plagued by mechanical
          issues).<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch30fn21" id="ch30fn21">171</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Skip the Business Case, Do the Analytics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="skip_the_business_casecomma_do_the_analy">Skip the Business Case, Do the Analytics</h3></div></div></div><p>At some point, when it comes time to go beyond interviewing
          people, you’ll need to build a business case. Traditional product
          managers build profit-and-loss analyses to try to justify their
          plans: they create a convincing business case, and once someone
          believes it, they get funding to proceed. But a Lean mindset
          reverses this: you sell the business model—not the plan—without a
          lot of prediction, and then rely heavily on analytics to decide
          whether to kill the product or double-down on it.</p><p>This analyze-after rather than predict-before model is
          possible because many of the costs of innovation can be pushed later
          in the product development cycle. Just-in-time manufacturing,
          on-demand printing, services that replace upfront investment with
          pay-by-the-drink capacity, CAD/CAM design, and mercenary contractors
          all mean that you don’t have to invest heavily up front (and
          therefore don’t have to argue a business case at the outset).
          Rather, you can ask for a modest budget, build analytics into the
          product, and launch sooner for less money. You can then use the data
          and customer feedback you get, which is vanishingly cheap to collect
          given today’s technology, to plead your case based on actual
          evidence.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Stickiness: Know Your Real Minimum"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="stickiness_know_your_real_minimum">Stickiness: Know Your Real Minimum</h3></div></div></div><p>If you’ve identified a problem worth solving and a solution
          that customers will want, it’s time to make an MVP. But you need to
          know the <span class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> minimum <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1769"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2305"/>that you can build. As a big organization, you may
          have restrictions on data sharing, reliability, or compliance to
          which smaller organizations (that have less to lose) aren’t subject.
          You also need to identify your unfair advantages.</p><p>Consider, for example, the many meal pre-ordering tools on the
          market today. These mobile applications let you place an order from
          a food court restaurant, pay, and pick up at an agreed-upon time
          without waiting. The restaurants like them because they save
          precious time in the lunchtime rush, and the diners like them
          because they’re simple and buyers can browse the menu at their
          leisure. It’s like Uber for lunch.</p><p>Now consider what would happen if McDonalds were to decide to
          compete by introducing an application. It might have franchise
          constraints, or regulations for restaurants located in airports, or
          state laws about disclosing caloric content. All of these would have
          to be part of the MVP.</p><p>Offsetting this, however, is the huge amount of market control
          the company has. It could promote the app by giving away three
          hamburgers for free to everyone who installed it. The company would
          make back the money quickly in saved time at the cash register, and
          have access to a new marketing channel and untapped analytical
          insight into its customers.</p><p>Intrapreneurs need to factor these kinds of constraints and
          advantages into their MVP far more than independent startups
          do.</p><p>What’s more, as people start using your MVP, you have to
          manage the beta process carefully. You may be interfering with
          existing deals in the sales pipeline, or creating more work for
          customer support. If so, you need to have approval for the rollout
          and the buy-in of stakeholders. If you’re launching an entirely new
          product line, you may even have to camouflage it so you don’t
          cannibalize existing markets until you know it’s successful. This,
          of course, undermines your ability to use unfair advantages like an
          existing customer base.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Viral from the Start"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="viral_from_the_start">Viral from the Start</h3></div></div></div><p>If you’re trying to move upward in the BCG box, your product
          should include viral and word-of-mouth elements. In a world where
          everyone has access to a mobile device, every product needs to have
          an interactive strategy. There’s simply no excuse not to find a
          viral angle to act as a force multiplier for growth. In fact, adding
          a viral component is one of the keys to moving dogs and cash cows up
          into question marks and stars.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Revenue Within the Ecosystem"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="revenue_within_the_ecosystem">Revenue Within the Ecosystem</h3></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1720"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1998"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2048"/>You’ll have less flexibility to set pricing and
          reinvest revenues in product marketing, because as you grow you’ll
          have to coexist with other marketing efforts by your host company.
          When Microsoft wanted to test its SaaS-based Office suite, it could
          do so in a relatively controlled way. But as soon as it wanted to
          monetize the product, it had to contend with cannibalization and
          pushback from a channel that depended on license revenue.</p><p>Your pricing may have to take into account channels,
          distributors, and other factors that restrict your freedom to
          experiment, because changes you make will have an impact on other
          products in the marketplace. Had Blockbuster entered the streaming
          video market, it would have had to deal with labor and real estate
          issues at existing stores.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Scale and the Handoff"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="scale_and_the_handoff">Scale and the Handoff</h3></div></div></div><p>In the final stages of intrapreneur innovation, the new
          product has proven its viability. It’s either stolen by a more
          mainstream part of the organization—which can help it cross the
          chasm and broaden its appeal—or the team that created it must itself
          transition to a more traditional, structured model of business and
          take its place among the other products and divisions of the host
          organization.</p><p>Most of the time, the DNA of a disruptive organization isn’t
          well suited to “boring” management and growth, so you’ll need to
          hand off the product to the rest of the organization and find the
          next thing to disrupt. That means you really have two customers: the
          external one buying the product, and the internal one that has to
          make, sell, and support it.</p><p>Ultimately, the intrapreneur must manage the relationship with
          the host organization as well as the relationship with the target
          market. Initially, this can be intentionally distant, but as the
          disruptive product becomes part of the host, the handoff must be
          graceful.</p></div></div><div class="footnotes" epub:type="footnotes"><br/><hr style="width: 100; align: left;"/><div class="footnote" id="ftn.ch30fn01"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#ch30fn01">151</a>] </sup><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project" target="_top">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project</a></em></span></p></div><div class="footnote" id="ftn.ch30fn02"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#ch30fn02">152</a>] </sup><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/technology/at-google-x-a-top-secret-lab-dreaming-up-the-future.html?_r=2" target="_top">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/technology/at-google-x-a-top-secret-lab-dreaming-up-the-future.html?_r=2</a></em></span></p></div><div class="footnote" id="ftn.ch30fn03"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#ch30fn03">153</a>] </sup><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_McCallum" target="_top">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_McCallum</a></em></span></p></div><div class="footnote" id="ftn.ch30fn04"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#ch30fn04">154</a>] </sup><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://beforeitsnews.com/banksters/2012/08/the-stanford-lectures-so-is-software-really-eating-the-world-2431478.html" target="_top">http://beforeitsnews.com/banksters/2012/08/the-stanford-lectures-so-is-software-really-eating-the-world-2431478.html</a></em></span></p></div><div class="footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="ftn.ch30fn05"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#ch30fn05">155</a>] </sup>Richard Templar, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Rules of Work</em></span>
