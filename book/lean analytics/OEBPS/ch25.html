        platforms.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch25fn03" id="ch25fn03">123</a>]</sup> Amazon and other general-purpose retailers also reward
        affiliate partners more handsomely than some more narrowly focused
        companies, because an affiliate referrer gets a percentage of the
        entire shopping cart. So if an author sends a visitor to Amazon to buy
        a book, and that buyer also purchases groceries, the author gets a
        percentage of the buyer’s grocery purchase as well. This encourages
        affiliate advertisers to give Amazon’s ads more prominence, since
        they’re more lucrative.</p><p>Derek Szeto feels that because Amazon’s conversion rates are
        high, affiliates are more likely to drive traffic to towards it sites.
        Amazon balances the richness of its affiliate program with a
        relatively short cookie lifetime—so an affiliate makes money from an
        Amazon buyer only if that person buys something within 24 hours of
        clicking the affiliate link.</p><p>Recall that blank ads showed a click-through rate of 0.08% in

        time. Chartbeat’s Joshua Schwartz says, “the lower total engaged time
        numbers for social sites, versus those for standard referrers, speaks
        to the fleeting nature of social pickups; while a referrer pickup may
        result in a sustained flow of traffic across days, social spikes are

        the page to report back as long as the visitor is engaged.</p><p>We asked Chartbeat to segment its measurement of this “engaged
        time” metric by the type of site. Sure enough, there’s a significant
        difference between media, e-commerce, and SaaS sites that reflects
        each site’s different usage patterns. Chartbeat’s research, aggregated

        landing page is only 47 seconds, but the engaged time on a non-landing
        page is 90 seconds. These numbers are considerably different from the
        averages previously discussed (61 seconds for landing pages and 76
        seconds for non-landing pages). In particular, SaaS sites have a low
        time on page, which is as it should be if the purpose of the site is
        to make users complete a task and be productive.</p><p>Joshua says, “The more analysis we do, the more we’re seeing
        that engaged time is especially crucial for media sites. While getting
        lots of eyeballs is important, if the traffic immediately bounces, it
        doesn’t do much good. So <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1593"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2140"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2333"/>engaged time as a metric is essentially measuring the

        Adage article by Buzzfeed’s Jon Steinberg and StumbleUpon’s Jack
        Krawczyk looked at how much popular stories had been shared.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch25fn05" id="ch25fn05">125</a>]</sup> As with many other metrics, there was a strong power
        law. The vast majority of stories were shared with <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1453"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1572"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1745"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1854"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2349"/>a small group, and only a tiny fraction was shared
        widely. On Facebook, the top 50 shared stories in the last five years
        had received hundreds of thousands—even millions—of views.</p><p>But despite these outliers, the median ratio of views to shares
        is just nine. That means that, typically, for every time a story is
        shared only nine people visited it. In other words, most sharing is
        intimate, among close-knit groups of peers. On Twitter, the median was
        5 to 1; on reddit, which promotes popular links on its home page, it
        was 36 to 1.</p><p>StumbleUpon looked at 5.5 million sharing actions in a 45-day
        period. It concluded that users shared “intimately” (to another

        on Montreal every summer for the Just For Laughs festival. Today, it’s
        the world’s largest international comedy festival.</p><p>In 2000, Just For Laughs Gags, a silent “hidden camera prank”
        show, began airing on television. You’ve probably seen these brief
        sketches; their short format and lack of spoken words makes them great
        for airplanes and other public places, as well as for global
        markets.</p><p>We talked with Carlos Pacheco, Digital Director at Just For
        Laughs, about his job monetizing Gags TV, the show’s YouTube
        channel.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>The Decline of Existing
        Channels</strong></span></p><p>“Until recently, the Gags TV series was primarily funded (and
        profitable) in the old-fashioned TV way,” Carlos explains. “With every
        new season, the TV and digital rights would be sold to local and
        international TV networks, which has kept the series going since its
        start 12 years ago.” But recently, producers saw a decline in
        licensing prices—basically, TV networks were no longer willing to pay
        the prices they had in the past.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1024"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2347"/>The show has had a YouTube channel since 2007, but it
        didn’t have much content and wasn’t being regularly maintained. The
        original plan was to create a dedicated website, relying heavily on
        Adobe Flash, that featured Just For Laughs content including stand-up
        and Gags. “Once that fell through, the team at Gags decided to
        concentrate on YouTube,” says Carlos. “Even though the channel had
        been a YouTube partner since 2009, it was only in early 2011 that the
        producers started to notice some revenue coming from the few videos
        that were there.” With the hypothesis that more videos would lead to
        more revenue, the team uploaded over 2,000 prank clips to the
        site.</p><p>Since its creation, Gags was formatted for television, which
        meant a half-hour show (with commercial breaks) featuring 12 to 14
        pranks. On YouTube, the half-hour constraints were gone. In many ways,
        the short format of a single prank was more suited to the Web than
        television. “The mass upload wasn’t done very strategically,” says
        Carlos, “but out of the 2,000 videos, a few got noticed and went
        viral, helping the channel grow, and ad revenue became significant in
        early 2012.”</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Getting the Ad Balance
        Right</strong></span></p><p>On YouTube, content owners can run ads in several ways. They can
        create overlays atop the video with clickable links, and they can
        screen ads before, during, or after the content. The content provider
        can also decide whether ads can be skipped or not. The right ad
        strategy is critical; more impressions and more ads means more revenue
        (measured in <span class="emphasis"><em>cost per engagement</em></span>, or CPE—the
        revenue earned from an ad impression), but those ads can turn viewers
        away.</p><p>Initially the only metrics the team looked at were daily views
        and revenue. Now they’re getting much more sophisticated, looking at
        metrics such as time watched per video, traffic sources, playback
        locations, demographics, annotations, and audience retention. A key
        goal is to analyze where people drop off from watching, which helps
        guide Carlos on the right formats for videos.</p><p>“For example, a few months ago we started producing web
        exclusive ‘best of Gags’ videos,” says Carlos. “The first videos
        featured a 10-to 15-second intro animation, but looking at the
        audience retention we saw a 30% drop-off within the first 15 seconds.
        After that, we modified the initial uploads and all future uploads to
        remove the intros, which gave our audience the content they really
        wanted as soon as they pressed play.”</p><p>Early on, Gags used only overlay ads on its content. Later, the
        team added a kind of skippable YouTube ad called TrueView pre-roll
        advertising, which increased overall CPE but didn’t slow down growth.
        “We didn’t want to start with anything other than TrueView, since our
        content is short. We knew our fans weren’t interested in sitting
        through a minute-long pre-roll ad just to watch a one- to two-minute
        prank video,” says Carlos. The team has also experimented with YouTube
        TV channels like Revision3, with good results.</p><p>In early 2012, YouTube announced that longer-form content would
        be prioritized in recommendations it made to viewers. Since the Gags
        team had seen other content producers uploading full TV episodes onto
        the site, they thought this would be a good way to experiment with
        uncut episodes that had forced pre-roll, mid-roll, and post-roll
        ads.</p><p>The results showed that even though the long form worked,
        shorter clips were still better:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>In the first 24 hours after a long-form video was uploaded,
            the number of views was nearly the same as those of a two-minute
            video clip, averaging 30,000–40,000 views.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Ad revenue per long-form video was five times higher than
            that from a two-minute clip. That might seem like a good thing,
            but a long-form video has around 12 individual clips, so it’s
            actually less lucrative.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Long-form video episodes have a longer tail of viewing—they
            keep a higher average number of daily views for a longer period
            than the short clips.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Audience retention is very different. Because the long-form
            episodes have introductions and are longer, there’s a 40% audience
            drop-off halfway into an episode, versus a 15% drop-off halfway
            into a single short video.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Merchandising on the
        Channel</strong></span></p><p>Until now, there has been no attempt to sell products via the
        channel. The Gags team gets requests to buy video, and even the music
        that accompanies each video. “This is a huge wasted opportunity for
        us, considering we generate over 4 million impressions a day,” says
        Carlos. “We have 4 to 5 million people walking into our store every
        day, but there’s nothing to buy. I’ve made it my personal mission to
        change this using YouTube-approved retailers (which allow us to link
        out from annotations) for our merchandise, as well as by partnering
        with digital distributors.”</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1313"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1319"/><span class="strong"><strong>To Take Down or
        Not?</strong></span></p><p>Gags owns all the rights to the content it uploads. With its
        viral, broadly appealing content, copying and repurposing material
        happens a lot, but the team doesn’t do any Digital Millennium
        Copyright Act (DMCA) takedowns. Part of this is simply getting the
        word out to new markets. “Most of the time, fan-made compilations and
        uploads to a personal YouTube account go viral in the uploader’s
        specific market,” says Carlos. “This has helped us expand our brand
        and audience to markets we never even thought of.”</p><p>But there’s another, more lucrative, reason for not having these
        videos taken down. “Every time a fan ‘repurposes’ our content on his
        or her personal YouTube channel, we see it in our content management
        system, and we’re given a choice: either take it down, release our
        claim, or reinstate our claim and monetize the uploaded content,” says
        Pacheco. “In almost every case, we reinstate the content and monetize
        these user-generated videos.”</p><p>Since deciding to focus on YouTube, the channel has grown
        dramatically, “In the last year, on average, there are 100,000
        user-generated Gags videos that generate 40–50% of our total monthly
        views,” says Carlos. “I’ve seen two-hour mash-up videos of our content
        that have generated millions of views, which is something we would
        never have thought of doing.”</p><p>Although fan-made videos bring in less revenue per engagement
        than Gags’ original content, the sheer volume of views represents a
        significant amount of total ad revenue. Carlos says, “I also pay
        attention to how fans are compiling these videos to see if we can
        learn from and mimic their success, since we often see UGC videos
        generate more views than ours.”</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>A Fundamentally New
        Opportunity</strong></span></p><p>Carlos points out that Gags’ growth on YouTube has happened
        completely independently from any marketing web support from the Just
        For Laughs festival or social media channels. Before February 2012,
        Gags had no official Facebook page, Twitter account, or web presence.
        “Of course, a key success factor that helped Gags grow is the fact
        that it’s been on the air for over 10 years in over 100 countries. But
        until recently, our online presence was almost nonexistent,” says
        Carlos.</p><p>Originally producers thought that uploading their full catalog
        to the Web would cannibalize TV sales. That didn’t happen. Television
        sales actually <span class="emphasis"><em>improved</em></span> as a result of Gags being
        discovered by new, untapped markets, and other online content
        providers are regularly reaching out to Gags with new monetization
        opportunities.</p><p>“The success of the YouTube channel over the last 12 months has
        turned things around for Gags,” says Carlos. “Producers are no longer
        at the mercy of television or cable networks. On top of that, with
        funding opportunities like YouTube original channels, there’s space
        for creators like us to build brand new online properties, which is
        something we’re seriously looking at.”</p><p>The nature of the Gags content, being mostly silent, helps it
        transcend borders, cultures, and languages. Carlos feels this has
        helped the brand expand dramatically: “Although our main channel will
        hit a billion views within the next few months, behind the scenes our
        total channel and UGC views are already past 2.1 billion.”</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Just For Laughs Gags produces short, popular comedy reels
