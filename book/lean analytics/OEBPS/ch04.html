It can be addictive, making you
      overanalyze everything. But much of what we actually do is unconscious,
      based on past experience and pragmatism. And with good reason: relying
      on wisdom and experience, rather than rigid analysis, helps us get
      through our day. After all, you don’t run A/B testing before deciding
      what pants to put on in the morning; if you did, you’d never get out the
      door.</p><p>One of the criticisms of Lean Startup is that it’s too
      data-driven. Rather than be a slave to the data, these critics say, we
      should use it as a tool. We should be data-informed, not data-driven.
      Mostly, they’re just being lazy, and looking for reasons not to do the
      hard work. But sometimes, they have a point: using data to optimize one
      part of your business, without stepping back and looking at the big
      picture, can be dangerous—even fatal.</p><p>Consider travel agency Orbitz and its discovery that Mac users
      were willing to reserve a more expensive hotel room. CTO Roger Liew told
      the <span class="emphasis"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></span>, “We had the intuition
      [that Mac users are 40% more likely to book a four- or five-star hotel
      than PC users and to stay in more expensive rooms], and we were able to
      confirm it based on the data.”<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch04fn01" id="ch04fn01">14</a>]</sup></p><p>On the one hand, an algorithm that ignores seemingly unrelated
      customer data (in this case, whether visitors were using a Mac) wouldn’t
      have found this opportunity to increase revenues. On the other hand, an
      algorithm that <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1216"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1243"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1304"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1309"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1408"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1430"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1630"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1826"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1840"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1841"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2014"/>blindly optimizes based on customer data, regardless of
      its relationship to the sale, may have unintended consequences—like bad
      PR. Data-driven machine optimization, when not moderated by human
      judgment, can cause problems.</p><p>Years ago, Gail Ennis, then CMO of analytics giant Omniture, told
      one of us that users of the company’s content optimization tools had to
      temper machine optimization with human judgment. Left to its own
      devices, the software quickly learned that scantily clad women generated
      a far higher click-through rate on web pages than other forms of
      content. But that click-through rate was a short-term gain, offset by
      damage to the brand of the company that relied on it. So Omniture’s
      software works alongside curators who understand the bigger picture and
      provide suitable imagery for the machine to test. <span class="emphasis"><em>Humans do
      inspiration; machines do validation</em></span>.</p><p>In mathematics, a local maximum is the largest value of a function
      within a given neighborhood.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch04fn02" id="ch04fn02">15</a>]</sup> That doesn’t mean it’s the largest
      <span class="emphasis"><em>possible</em></span> value, just the largest one in a
      particular range. As an analogy, consider a lake on a mountainside. The
      water isn’t at its lowest possible level—that would be sea level—but
      it’s at the lowest possible level in the area surrounding the
      lake.</p><p>Optimization is all about finding the lowest or highest values of
      a particular function. A machine can find the optimal settings for
      something, but only within the constraints and problem space of which
      it’s aware, in much the same way that the water in a mountainside lake
      can’t find the lowest possible value, just the lowest value within the
      constraints provided.</p><p>To understand the problem with constrained optimization, imagine
      that you’re given three wheels and asked to evolve the best, most stable
      vehicle. After many iterations of pitting different wheel layouts
      against one another, you come up with a tricycle-like configuration.
      It’s the optimal three-wheeled configuration.</p><p>Data-driven optimization can perform this kind of iterative
      improvement. What it can’t do, however, is say, “You know what? Four
      wheels would be way better!” Math is good at optimizing a known system;
      humans are good at finding a new one. Put another way, <span class="emphasis"><em>change
      favors local maxima; innovation favors global
      disruption</em></span>.</p><p>In his book <span class="emphasis"><em>River Out Of Eden</em></span> (Basic Books),
      Richard Dawkins uses the analogy of a flowing river to describe
      evolution. Evolution, he explains, can create the eye. In fact, it can
      create dozens of versions of it, for <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1202"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1302"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1642"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1807"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1850"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1950"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2015"/>wasps, octopods, humans, eagles, and whales. What it can’t
      do well is go <span class="emphasis"><em>backward</em></span>: once you have an eye that’s
      useful, slight mutations don’t usually yield improvements. A human won’t
      evolve an eagle’s eye, because the intermediate steps all result in bad
      eyesight.</p><p>Machine-only optimization suffers from similar limitations as
      evolution. If you’re optimizing for local maxima, you might be missing a
      bigger, more important opportunity. It’s your job to be the intelligent
      designer to data’s evolution.</p><p>Many of the startup founders with whom we’ve spoken have a
      fundamental mistrust of leaving their businesses to numbers alone. They
      want to trust their guts. They’re uneasy with their companies being
      optimized without a soul, and see the need to look at the bigger picture
      of the market, the problem they’re solving, and their fundamental
      business models.</p><p>Ultimately, quantitative data is great for testing hypotheses, but
      it’s lousy for generating new ones unless combined with human
      introspection.</p><div class="sect1 pattern" title="How to Think Like a Data Scientist"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="pattern_how_to_think_like_a_data_scienti" style="clear: both">How to Think Like a Data Scientist</h2></div></div></div><p>Monica Rogati, a data scientist at LinkedIn, gave us the

              clean.</strong></span></strong></span> Cleaning the data you capture is often most of the work,
              and the simple act of cleaning it up can often reveal important
              patterns. “Is an instrumentation bug causing 30% of your numbers
              to be null?” asks Monica. “Do you really have that many users in
              the 90210 zip code?” Check your data at the door to be sure it’s

              a wedding, but unless you consider the total number of air

              restaurants?” This might give you a few great ideas about what

        data-obsessed, but tend to get mired in analysis paralysis. Others are
        casual, shoot-from-the-hip intuitionists who ignore data unless it
        suits them, and pivot lazily from idea to idea without discipline. At
        the root of this divide is the fundamental challenge that Lean Startup
        advocates face: how do you have a minimum viable product and a hugely
        compelling vision at the same time?</p><p>Plenty of founders use Lean Startup as an excuse to start a
        company without a vision. “It’s so easy to start a company these
        days.” They reason, “the barriers are so low that everyone can do it,
        right?” Yet having a big vision is important: starting a company
        without one makes you susceptible to outside influences, be they from
        customers, investors, competition, press, or anything else. Without a
        big vision, you’ll lack purpose, and over time you’ll find yourself
        wandering aimlessly.</p><p>So if a big, hairy, audacious vision is important—one with a
        changing-the-world type goal—how does that reconcile with the
        step-by-step, always-questioning approach of Lean Startup?</p><p>The answer is actually pretty simple. You need to think of Lean
        Startup as the process you use to move toward and achieve your
        vision.</p><p>We sometimes remind early-stage founders that, in many ways,
        they aren’t building a product. <span class="emphasis"><em>They’re building a tool to
        learn what product to build</em></span>. This helps separate the task
        at hand—finding a sustainable business model—from the screens, lines
        of code, and mailing lists they’ve carefully built along the
        way.</p><p>Lean Startup is focused on learning above everything else, and
        encourages broad thinking, exploration, and experimentation. It’s not
        about mindlessly going through the motions of
        <span class="emphasis"><em>build</em></span>&gt;<span class="emphasis"><em>measure</em></span>&gt;<span class="emphasis"><em>learn</em></span>—it’s
        about really understanding what’s going on and being open to new
        possibilities.</p><p>Be Lean. Don’t be small. We’ve talked to founders who want to be
        the leading provider in their state or province. Why not the world?
        Even the Allies had to pick a beachhead, but landing in Normandy
        didn’t mean they lacked a big vision. They just found a good place to
        start.</p><p>Some people believe Lean Startup encourages that smallness, but
        in fact, used properly, Lean Startup helps <span class="emphasis"><em>expand</em></span>
        your vision, because you’re encouraged to question everything. As you
        dig deeper and peel away more layers of what you’re doing—whether
        you’re looking at problems, solutions, customers, revenue, or anything
        else—you’re likely to find a lot more than you expected. If you’re
        opportunistic about it, you can expand your vision and understand how
        to get there faster, all at the same time.</p></div><div class="footnotes" epub:type="footnotes"><br/><hr style="width: 100; align: left;"/><div class="footnote" id="ftn.ch04fn01"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#ch04fn01">14</a>] </sup><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304458604577488822667325882.html" target="_top">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304458604577488822667325882.html</a></em></span></p></div><div class="footnote" id="ftn.ch04fn02"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#ch04fn02">15</a>] </sup><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima" target="_top">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima</a></em></span></p></div></div></section></body></html>
