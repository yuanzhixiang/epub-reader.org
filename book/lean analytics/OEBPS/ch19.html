You’ve got virality
      that’s multiplying the effectiveness of your marketing efforts. And you
      have revenues coming in to fuel those user and customer acquisition
      efforts.</p><p>The final stage for startups is Scale, which represents not only a
      wider audience, but also entry into new markets, a modicum of
      predictability and sustainability, and deals with new partners. Your
      startup is becoming part of a broader ecosystem, in which you’re a known
      and active participant. If the Revenue stage was about proving a
      business, the Scale stage is about proving a market.</p><div class="sect1" title="The Hole in the Middle"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="hole_in_the_middle" style="clear: both">The Hole in the Middle</h2></div></div></div><p>Harvard professor Michael Porter describes a variety of generic
        strategies by which companies compete.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch19fn01" id="ch19fn01">73</a>]</sup> Firms can focus on a niche market (a segmentation
        strategy), they can focus on being efficient (a cost strategy), or
        they can try to be unique (a differentiation strategy). A local,
        gluten-free coffee shop focuses on a specific customer niche, Costco
        focuses on efficiency and low costs, and Apple focuses on branded
        design and uniqueness.<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.ch19fn02" id="ch19fn02">74</a>]</sup> Some companies have different focuses for supply and
        demand—Amazon, for <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1083"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1133"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1710"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2043"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2049"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2094"/>example, is ruthlessly efficient on backend
        infrastructure from suppliers, and brand-heavy on differentiating for
        demand.</p><p>Porter observed that firms with a large market share (Apple,
        Costco, Amazon) were often profitable, but so were those with a small
        market share (the coffee shop). The problem was companies that were
        neither small nor large. He termed this the “hole in the middle”
        problem—the challenge facing firms that are too big to adopt a niche
        strategy efficiently, but too small to compete on cost or scale. They
        need to differentiate themselves to survive the midsize gap, and then
        achieve scale and efficiency.</p><p>This is why the Scale stage is so critical. It’s the last test
        before you’ve identified and quantified all of the risks in your
        startup. It’s where you find out what you’ll be when you grow
        up.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Metrics for the Scale Stage"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="metrics_for_the_scale_stage" style="clear: both">Metrics for the Scale Stage</h2></div></div></div><p>This stage is where you look beyond your own company. If you
        focus too early on competitors, you can be blinded by what they’re
        doing, rather than learning what your customers actually need. But by
        now, you have enough of a groove to look outside. You’ll find that
        it’s a crowded world, where you’re competing with everyone for
        attention.</p><p>We’ve known that getting enough of the right kind of attention
        was going to be a problem for three decades. In 1981, cognitive
        scientist and economist Herbert Simon observed that we live in an
        information age, and that information consumes attention—in other
        words, attention is a precious commodity, and its value grows as we’re
        flooded with more and more information. In this stage, you’re checking
        whether analysts, competitors, and distributors care about you as much
        as your core group of initial customers does. Getting attention at
        scale means your product or service can stand on its own, without your
        constant love and feeding.</p><p>In the Scale stage, you want to compare higher-order metrics
        like Backupify’s OMTM—customer acquisition payback—across channels,
        regions, and marketing campaigns. For example: is a customer you
        acquire through channels less valuable than one you acquire yourself?
        Does it take longer to pay back direct sales or telemarketing? Are
        international revenues hampered by taxes? These are signs that you
        won’t be able to scale independent of your own organizational
        growth.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Is My Business Model Right?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="is_my_business_model_rightquestion_mark" style="clear: both">Is My Business Model Right?</h2></div></div></div><p>In the Scale stage, many of the metrics you’ve used to optimize
        a particular part of the business now become inputs into your
        accounting system. Data <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1123"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1486"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1754"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2041"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2320"/>like sales, margins, and customer support costs now help
        you project cash flow and understand how much investment you’ll
        need.</p><p>Lean tends not to touch on these things, but they’re important
        for bigger, more established organizations that have found their
        product/market fit, and for intrapreneurs trying to convince more
        risk-averse stakeholders within their organization. Even though you
        may not be “Lean” in the strict sense of the word, you may still have
        to pivot in order to operate at scale.</p><p>Consider, for example, a product sold through direct sales. If
        you try to introduce the product to channels, those channels may not
        be equipped to sell and support the product. Your own support costs go
        up; returns or abandonment from channel-sold customers climbs. What
        should you do?</p><p>One approach is to change the market the channel serves. You
        could handle high-touch customers with consulting needs through direct
        sales, but offer a simplified version that’s less customizable to the
        channel. Or you could try changing the markets at which your channel
        is aimed—focusing on government sales, or buyers in higher education,
        who are better able to serve themselves.</p><p>These might not seem like Lean pivots, but they’re done with the
        same kind of discipline and experimentation that informed your earlier
        product and pricing decisions.</p><p>If you’re in a good business, you’ll soon have an ecosystem of
        competitors, channel partners, third-party developers, and more. To
        thrive, you need to claim your place in this market and establish the
        kinds of barriers to entry that maintain margins in the face of
        competition. At this point, you’ve moved beyond the Lean Startup
        model, but that doesn’t mean you’ve stopped obsessing over iterative
        learning.</p><p>Scaling is good if it brings in incremental revenue, but you
        have to watch for a decrease in engagement, a gradual saturation of
        the initial market, or a rising cost of customer acquisition. Changes
        in churn, segmented by channels, show whether you’re growing your most
        important asset—your customers—or hemorrhaging attention as you
        scale.</p></div><div class="sect1 case_study" title="Buffer Goes from Stickiness to Scale (Through Revenue)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_buffer_goes_from_stickiness_t" style="clear: both">Buffer Goes from Stickiness to Scale (Through Revenue)</h2></div></div></div><p>Buffer is a startup that was founded in 2010 by Tom Moor, Leo
        Widrich, and Joel Gascoigne. Joel kick-started Buffer because of a
        pain he was experiencing: the difficulty of posting great content he
        was finding regularly to Twitter. Solutions already existed for
        scheduling <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1475"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1958"/>tweets, but nothing as simple and easy to use as what
        Joel was looking for, so he joined forces with Tom and Leo, and they
        built Buffer.</p><p>Unlike most companies in the social software space, they decided
        to charge customers right off the bat. Joel had two assumptions: that
        the problem was painful enough for people, and that they would pay.
        Taking a very Lean approach, the trio built and launched the app and
        had their first paying customers in seven weeks.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch19fn03" id="ch19fn03">75</a>]</sup></p><p>For Buffer, their One Metric That Matters was revenue. As Joel
        says, “We were constrained by our situation: track record and location
        [being based in New Zealand] made it a challenge to seriously consider
        raising funding, and I had no funds to dip into and was working
        full-time for other clients. This meant the most important metric was
        revenue, since I needed to grow the revenue in my spare time to a
        position where I could quit my existing work.”</p><p>Joel and his team decided to go with a freemium approach (which
        they still have today), so along with the all-important metric of
        revenue, they were looking at other metrics around signups,
        activation, and conversion. “Early on, the most important metrics were
        activation, retention, and revenue,” says Joel. “I think good metrics
        here are the signs of a solid product. Revenue mattered the most
        because I was literally calculating how many users we’d need based on
        our conversion in order for me to quit my work. As soon as we hit that
        amount, we grew faster, and shortly after hitting ‘ramen
        profitability’ we jumped on a plane to San Francisco, went through the
        AngelPad incubator, and raised our seed round.”</p><p>Joel shared some numbers with us:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>20% of visitors create an account (acquisition).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>64% of people who sign up become “active” (which the
            founders define as posting one status update using Buffer).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>60% of people who sign up come back in the first month
            (engagement/stickiness).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>20% of people who sign up come back (are still active) after
            six months (engagement/stickiness).</p></li></ul></div><p>Their conversion is between 1.5% and 2.5% from free to paid.
        Joel uses cohort analysis to measure these results, and says that
        Buffer sees a similar result to what Evernote has, where over time
        more users convert into paying customers. “For example, for the cohort
        of users who signed up in February 2012, 1.3% upgraded in their first
        month using the product,” says Joel. “After six months, 1.9% of the
        same cohort is paying customers.”</p><p>Once these numbers became clear and consistent, and revenue got
        to the point where Buffer was profitable, Joel felt it was time to
        make the switch and focus on acquisition. This was a big shift from
        proving the product and its stickiness at a small scale to trying to
        grow at a much faster pace. “For starters, we realized that
        personally, it would be most satisfying if we could make Buffer a very
        widespread service with millions of users,” says Joel. “Then we
        checked our churn, because we know that it’s vital before focusing on
        acquisition.” Joel’s target was below 5%, and in fact Buffer’s churn
        hovers around 2%, so, the team doesn’t invest a lot of time trying to
        improve it, which gives them the comfort to focus on
        acquisition.</p><p>Buffer is also profitable, which gives them the flexibility to
        push acquisition, try new channels, and not burn cash or be forced to
        raise more capital. Before finally deciding to focus on acquisition,
        they did look at other metrics. Joel says, “We could probably double
        our conversion to paying customers if we worked hard on it, but that
        requires focus just like anything else. And that can come later,
        because what we want the most is to have a huge user base.”</p><p>The company is now in growth mode, trying new channels and
        focusing on user acquisition—but it still keeps an eye on conversion
        and revenue. Joel points out, “We measure the funnel of our new
        channels to ensure that they still convert to paying
        customers.”</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Buffer used revenue early on as a measure of stickiness; the
            founders’ goal wasn’t to generate tons of revenue and scale, but
            to generate enough to prove they had a legitimate, scalable
            business.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Buffer runs ongoing cohort analysis to assess changes it’s
            making in its product as well as in its marketing
            initiatives.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>When it proved its product was sticky, it moved its focus to
            acquisition and how to acquire more users at a low cost.</p></li></ul></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1069"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2046"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2198"/><span class="strong"><strong>Analytics Lessons
        Learned</strong></span></p><p>Reality counts. Your choice of when to focus on revenue may be
        dictated by realities of your industry or your economic climate. If
        you prove that early users will pay for the initial offering in
        sufficient numbers, you not only have clear proof that you’ve found a
        good market, but you also have much more freedom to grow and evolve on
        your own terms. Combine revenue and engagement, and you know if your
        product has enough long-term value to be scalable. When you get to
        that point, you can start to scale acquisition.</p><p>By now, you’re a bigger organization. You’re worrying about more
        people, doing more things, in more ways. It’s easy to get distracted.
        So we’d like to propose a simple way of focusing on metrics that gives
        you the ability to change while avoiding the back-and-forth whipsawing
        that can come from management-by-opinion. We call it the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Three-Threes Model</em></span>. It’s really the
        organizational implementation of the Problem-Solution Canvas we saw in
        <a class="xref" href="ch16.html" title="Chapter 16. Stage Two: Stickiness">Chapter 16</a>.</p></div><div class="sect1 pattern" title="The Three-Threes Model"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="pattern_the_three-threes_model" style="clear: both">The Three-Threes Model</h2></div></div></div><p>At this stage, you probably have three tiers of management.
        There’s the board and founders, focused on strategic issues and major
        shifts, meeting monthly or quarterly. There’s the executive team,
        focused on tactics and oversight, meeting weekly. And there’s the
        rank-and-file, focused on execution, and meeting daily.</p><p>Don’t get us wrong: for many startups, the same people may be at
        all three of these meetings. It’s just that you’ll have very different
        mindsets as a board than you will as the person who’s writing code,
        stuffing boxes, or negotiating a sale.</p><p>We’ve also found that it’s hard to keep more than three things
        in your mind at once. But if you can limit what you’re working on to
        just three big things, then everyone in the company knows what they’re
        doing and why they’re doing it.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Three Big Assumptions</strong></span></p><p>In your current business model, you have some fundamental
        assumptions, such as “people will answer questions,” or “organizers
        are frustrated with how to run conferences,” or “we’ll make money from
        parents.” Some of these may be platform assumptions too: “Amazon Web
        Services are reliable enough for our users.”</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1016"/>Each assumption has a metric associated with it, and a
        line in the sand. This is your big bet. These are the cells in your
        spreadsheet that you obsess over as a board. They’re what you look at
        to see if you can make payroll, or how much investment you’re going to
        need, or whether the marketing campaigns are bringing in more than
        they’re costing, or whether your business model is hopelessly,
        fatally, doomed.</p><p>Assumptions like these shouldn’t change more than once a month
        (unless you’re in an accelerator program or have an artificial time
        constraint). They certainly shouldn’t change that often when you’re at
        the Scale stage; that kind of thrashing dulls momentum, like pumping
        the tiller on a sailboat. Changing fundamental assumptions around your
        business model may require board approval, and will likely alienate
        your customers and bewilder your employees unless properly
        communicated. The board and your advisors should be involved in the
        assumptions at the Scale stage.</p><p>These three assumptions should leap off the page of your Lean
        Canvas if you’re doing it right. Of course, if you change business
        models entirely, you’ll have another big three assumptions because you
        now have another canvas.</p><p>Each month, the three assumptions should be communicated to the
        entire organization. The executive team is responsible for validating
        or repudiating them at the next meeting.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Three Actions to Take</strong></span></p><p>At the executive level, you need to define the tactics that will
        make the big assumptions happen. The whole company should know them,
        and it’s the executive team’s job to break each of them down into
        three actions that can happen this week.</p><p>For each board-level assumption, what three tactical actions are
        you taking to get those metrics to move in the right direction? These
        may be product enhancements or marketing strategies that you think
        will make the product better. They’re your feature roadmap and your
        marketing campaign for the week. They’ll change regularly. You need to
        survey, test, and prototype quickly to approve or kill things. It’s
        like a scrum in Agile.</p><p>While there’s a lot of latitude for executives to try to move
        the needle, they have to report back to the founders and board at the
        end of the month. This keeps them from straying too far from the
        prescribed business model—striking a balance between innovation and
        predictability that’s needed for later-stage companies.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1438"/><span class="strong"><strong>Three Experiments to
        Run</strong></span></p><p>On a daily basis, the company is performing individual tasks to
        try to complete the tactical actions. Anyone in the company can run a
        test—from speaking with customers to tweaking features to running a
        survey to conducting a pricing experiment—provided it’s documented
        beforehand and the results contribute to the week’s actions. The test
        is the only indicator of what you’re doing right or wrong. It’s done
        daily, and it’s like a sprint in Agile.</p><p>For each of those actions, what three tasks are you performing?
        What three experiments are you running? How will you choose the
        winner? This is execution, discussed with the action owner every day.
        Again, this means a wide range of flexibility at the ground level,
        while introducing a degree of structure.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Finding Discipline as You Scale"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="finding_discipline_as_you_scale" style="clear: both">Finding Discipline as You Scale</h2></div></div></div><p>Discipline is key to success in a larger, later-stage startup,
        particularly in the furious heat of execution. You can’t thrash wildly
        in search of inspiration—you have investors, employees, and
        expectations. But at the same time, you need the latitude that made
        you agile and adaptive in the first place.</p><p>Know, clearly, what assumptions underpin your fundamental
        business model. Then, with the approval of stakeholders, change one of
        them. Hand that change to the executive team: which features do you
        think will improve that basic assumption? Plan out your daily
        activities to test those features: have conversations with customers,
        run surveys, create a segment that tests the new code, try mockups.
        This combination of agility and methodical precision is what
        distinguishes great startups from stalled ones.</p><p>It’s almost a cliché at some tech events to ask, “What’s your
        latest pivot?” This is horrible. Plenty of disenchanted founders say,
        “I’m pivoting” when they should be saying, “I’m a confused idiot with
        ADHD!” <span class="emphasis"><em>Avoid the “lazy pivot.”</em></span> Without a plan,
        it’s just flapping in the wind. Discipline makes everyone accountable
        to one another.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="A Summary of the Scale Stage"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="summary_of_the_scale_stage" style="clear: both">A Summary of the Scale Stage</h2></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2050"/>When you’re scaling, you know your product and your
