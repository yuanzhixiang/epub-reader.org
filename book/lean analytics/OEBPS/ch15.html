      what’s important to people and being empathetic to their problems.
      You’re searching through listening. You’re digging for opportunity
      through caring about others. Right now, your job isn’t to prove you’re
      smart, or that you’ve found a solution.</p><p>Your job is to <span class="emphasis"><em>get inside someone else’s
      head</em></span>.</p><p>That means discovering and validating a problem and then finding
      out whether your proposed solution to that problem is likely to
      work.</p><div class="sect1" title="Metrics for the Empathy Stage"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="metrics_for_the_empathy_stage" style="clear: both">Metrics for the Empathy Stage</h2></div></div></div><p>In the Empathy stage, your focus is on gathering qualitative
        feedback, primarily through problem and solution interviews. Your goal
        is to find a problem worth solving and a solution that’s sufficiently
        good to garner early traction. You’re collecting this information by
        <span class="emphasis"><em>getting out of the building</em></span>. If you haven’t
        gotten out of the building enough—and spoken to at least 15 people at
        each interviewing stage—you should be very concerned about rushing
        ahead.</p><p>Early on, you’ll keep copious notes. Later, you might score the
        interviews to keep track of which needs and solutions were of the
        greatest interest, because this will tell you what features need to be
        in your minimum viable product (MVP).</p></div><div class="sect1" title="This Is the Best Idea I’ve Ever Had! (or, How to Discover Problems Worth Solving)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="this_is_the_best_idea_iapostropheve_ever" style="clear: both">This Is the Best Idea I’ve Ever Had! (or, How to Discover
        Problems Worth Solving)</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1373"/>Entrepreneurs are always coming up with ideas. While
        some people say “ideas are easy,” that’s not entirely true. Coming up
        with an idea is hard. Coming up with a good idea is harder. Coming up
        with an idea that you go out and validate to the point where it makes
        sense to build something is really, really hard.</p><p>Problem (or idea) discovery often starts with listening. After
        all, people love to complain about their problems. But take their
        complaining with a grain of salt. You need to listen actively, almost
        aggressively, for the nugget of truth or the underlying pattern. Big,
        lucrative startups are often the result of wildly audacious solutions
        to problems people didn’t realize they had.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Discovery is the muse that launches
        startups</em></span>.</p><p>In some cases, you won’t need to discover a problem. It will be
        the reason you founded a startup in the first place. This is
        particularly true for enterprise-focused initiatives or startup
        efforts that happen within a willing host company. As an intrapreneur,
        you may have noticed a pattern in customer support issues that
        suggests the need for a new product. If you’re selling to enterprises,
        maybe you were an end user who realized something was missing, or a
        former employee of a vendor who saw an opportunity.</p><p>Your idea is simply a starting point. You should let it marinate
        awhile before jumping into it. We’re huge believers in doing things
        quickly, but there’s a difference between focused speed in a smart
        direction and being ridiculously hasty. Your first instinct will be to
        talk to your friends. This isn’t a genuine or measurable part of Lean
        Startup, but it’s not a bad first step. Ideally, you’ve got a group of
        friends, or trusted advisors, who are in and around the relevant space
        of interest, from whom you can get a quick reality check.</p><p>Your trusted friends and advisors will give you their gut
        reaction (see—we don’t hate guts at all!), and if they’re not
        pandering to you or trying to avoid hurting your feelings, then you’ll
        get at least semi-honest feedback. You may also get some insight that
        you hadn’t thought of: information about competitors, target markets,
        different takes on the idea, and so on.</p><p>This quick “sniff test” is an excellent investment for the first
        few days after you get an idea, before committing any formal work to
        it. If the idea passes the sniff test, it’s time to apply the Lean
        Startup process.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Finding a Problem to Fix (or, How to Validate a Problem)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="finding_a_problem_to_fix_left_parenthesi" style="clear: both">Finding a Problem to Fix (or, How to Validate a

        the problem is <span class="emphasis"><em>painful enough</em></span> for
        <span class="emphasis"><em>enough people</em></span> and to learn
        <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> they are currently trying to solve it. Let’s
        break down what that means:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>The problem is painful enough</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>People are full of inertia. You want them to act, and you
              want them to do so in a way that helps your business. This
              requires enough discomfort with their situation that they
              actually do what you want—signing up, paying your price,
              etc.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Enough people care</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>Solving a problem for one person is called consulting. You
              need an addressable market. Marketers want audiences that are
              <span class="emphasis"><em>homogeneous within</em></span> (that is, members of the
              segment have things in common to which you can appeal) and
              <span class="emphasis"><em>heterogeneous between</em></span> (that is, you can
              segment and target each market segment in a focused manner with
              a tailored message).</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>They’re already trying to solve
            it</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>If the problem is real and known, people are dealing with
              it somehow. Maybe they’re doing something manually, because they
              don’t have a better way. The current solution, whatever it is,
              will be your biggest competitor at first, because it’s the path
              of least resistance for people.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Note that in some cases, your market won’t know it has a
        problem. Before the Walkman, the minivan, or the tablet computer,
        people didn’t know they had a need—indeed, Apple’s ill-fated Newton a
        decade before the iPad showed that the need didn’t exist. In this
        case, rather than just testing for a problem people know they have,
        you’re also interested in <span class="emphasis"><em>what it takes to make them aware
        of the problem</em></span>. If you’re going to have to “plow the snow”
        in your market, you want to know how much effort it will be so you can
        factor that into your business models.</p><p>You need to validate each of these (and a few more things too)
        before moving to the next stage. And analytics plays a key role in
        doing so.</p><p>Initially, as we’ve pointed out, you’ll use qualitative metrics
        to measure whether or not the problem you’ve identified is worth
        pursuing. You start this process by conducting problem interviews with
        prospective customers.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1517"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1866"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1921"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1945"/>We suggest that you speak with 15 prospective customers
        to start. After the first handful of interviews, you’ll likely see
        patterns emerging already. Don’t stop talking to people. Once you get
        to 15 interviews, you should have the validation (or invalidation)
        that you need to help clarify the next steps.</p><p>If you can’t find 15 people to talk to, well, imagine how hard
        it’s going to be to sell to them. So suck it up and get out of the
        office. Otherwise, you’re wasting time and money building something
        nobody wants.</p><p>While the data you’re collecting at this stage is qualitative,
        it has to be material enough so that you can honestly say, “Yes, this
        problem is painful enough that I should go ahead and build a
        solution.” One customer doesn’t make a market. You can’t speak with a
        few people, get generic positive feedback, and decide it’s worth
        jumping in.</p></div><div class="sect1 pattern" title="Signs You’ve Found a Problem Worth Tackling"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="pattern_signs_youapostropheve_found_a_pr" style="clear: both">Signs You’ve Found a Problem Worth Tackling</h2></div></div></div><p>The key to qualitative data is patterns and pattern recognition.
        Here are a few positive patterns to look out for when interviewing
        people:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>They want to pay you right away.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They’re actively trying to (or have tried to) solve the

            passion for the problem.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They lean forward and are animated (positive body

            chairs (negative body language).</p></li></ul></div><p>At the end of the problem interviews, it’s time for a gut check.
        Ask yourself: “am I prepared to spend the next five years of my life
        doing nothing else but solving the problem in question?”</p></div><div class="sect1 pattern" title="Running Lean and How to Conduct a Good Interview"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="pattern_running_lean_and_how_to_conduct" style="clear: both">Running Lean and How to Conduct a Good Interview</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1665"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2021"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2059"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2122"/>Ash Maurya is one of the leaders in the Lean Startup
        movement. He’s experimented and documented Lean Startup practices for
        several years with his own startups, and he wrote a great book called
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Running Lean</em></span> (O’Reilly). It’s a good complement
        to this book.</p><p>Ash describes a prescriptive, systematic approach for
        interviewing people during the early stages of the Lean Startup
        process.</p><p>For starters, you need to conduct problem interviews. You
        decouple the solution (which we know you’re excited about!) from the
        problem, and focus on the problem alone. The goal is to find a problem
        worth solving. And remember, customers are tired of solutions—they get
        pitched continually on magical doohickeys that will make their lives
        easier. But most of the time, the people pitching don’t understand the
        customers’ real problems.</p><p>Here are some tips from Ash and <span class="emphasis"><em>Running
        Lean</em></span> for conducting good interviews:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p title="Aim for face-to-face interviews."><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Aim for face-to-face
              interviews.</strong></span></strong></span> You not only want to hear what people are saying, you also
              want to see how they’re saying it. People are generally much
              less distracted when meeting face-to-face, so you’ll get a
              higher quality of response.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Pick a neutral location."><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Pick a neutral
              location.</strong></span></strong></span> If you go to a subject’s office, it’s going to feel more
              like a sales pitch. Find a coffee shop or something
              casual.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Avoid recording interviews."><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Avoid recording
              interviews.</strong></span></strong></span> Ash notes that in his experience, subjects get more
              self-conscious if the interview is being recorded, and the
              quality of interviews subsequently drops.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Make sure you have a script."><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Make sure you have a
              script.</strong></span></strong></span> While you may adjust the script a bit over time, you’re
              not tweaking it constantly in order to “get the answers you
              want” or rig anything in your favor. You have to stay honest
              throughout the process.</p></li></ul></div><p>The script is probably the hardest thing to do well. Early on,
        you may not even be sure what questions to ask. In fact, that’s why
        surveys don’t work at an early stage—you just don’t know what to ask
        in order to collect meaningful information. But a script will give you
        enough consistency from interview to interview that you can compare
        notes.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2125"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2192"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2193"/>Most of the problem interview is fairly open-ended. You
        want to give subjects the opportunity to tell you whatever they want
        to, and you want them to do so in a comfortable free-form
        manner.</p><p>In <span class="emphasis"><em>Running Lean</em></span>, Ash provides a very good
        breakdown of interview scripts. We’ve summarized the problem interview
        script as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Briefly <span class="strong"><strong>set the stage</strong></span> for
            how the interview works. This is the point where you tell the
            interviewee what you’re going to tell (or ask) her. Highlight the
            goals of the interview to put the interviewee in the right frame
            of mind.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Test the customer segment</strong></span>
            by collecting demographics. Ask the subject some basic questions
            to learn more about her and understand what market segment she
            represents. These questions depend a great deal on the types of
            people you speak to. Ultimately, you want to learn about their
            business or their lifestyle (in the context of the problems you’re
            proposing to solve), and learn more about their role.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Set the problem context</strong></span>
            by telling a story. Connect with the subject by walking her
            through how you identified the problems you’re hoping to solve,
            and why you think these problems matter. If you’re scratching your
            own itch, this will be a lot easier. If you don’t understand the
            problems clearly, or you don’t have good hypotheses for the
            problems you’re looking to solve, it’s going to show at this
            point.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Test the problem</strong></span> by
            getting the subject to rank the problems. Restate the problems
            you’ve described and ask the subject to rank them in order of
            importance. Don’t dig too deeply, but make sure to ask her if
            there are other related problems that you didn’t touch on.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Test the solution.</strong></span>
            Explore the subject’s worldview. Hand things over to the customer
            and listen. Go through each problem—in the order the subject
            ranked them—and ask the subject how she solves it today. There’s
            no more script. Just let the subject talk. This is the point in
            the interview when you can really do a qualitative assessment of
            whether or not you’ve found problems worth solving. It may go
            well, with subjects begging you to solve the problem, or you might
            get a resounding “meh,” in which case there’s a clear disconnect
            between your business and the real world.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1100"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1518"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1864"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1942"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1947"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2213"/><span class="strong"><strong>Ask for something</strong></span>
            now that you’re done. You don’t want to discuss your solution at
            length here, because it will feel too much like a sales call, but
            you should use a high-level pitch to keep the subject excited.
            Ideally, you want her to agree to do a solution interview with you
            when you’re ready with something to show—these initial subjects
            can become your first customers—and you want her to refer other
            people like her so you can do more interviews.</p></li></ul></div><p>As you can tell, there’s a lot that goes into conducting a good
        interview. You won’t be great at it the first time, but that’s OK.
        Hopefully some of what we’ve covered here and other resources will
        give you the tools you need. Get a good script in place, practice it,
        and get out there as quickly as you can. After a handful of
        interviews, you’ll be very comfortable with the process and you’ll
        start seeing trends and collecting information that’s incredibly
        valuable. You’ll also be immeasurably better at stating the problem
        clearly and succinctly, and you’ll collect anecdotes that will help
        with blogger outreach, investor discussions, and marketing
        collateral.</p><p>Qualitative metrics are all about trends. You’re trying to tease
        out the truth by identifying patterns in people’s feedback. You have
        to be an exceptionally good listener, at once empathetic and
        dispassionate. You have to be a great detective, chasing the “red
        threads” of the underlying narrative, the commonalities between
        multiple interviewees that suggest the right direction. Ultimately,
        those patterns become the things you test quantitatively, at scale.
        You’re looking for hypotheses.</p><p>The reality of qualitative metrics is that they turn wild
        hunches—your gut instinct, that nagging feeling in the back of your
        mind—into educated guesses you can run with. Unfortunately, because
        they’re subjective and gathered interactively, qualitative metrics are
        the ones that are easiest to fake.</p><p>While <span class="emphasis"><em>quantitative</em></span> metrics can be wrong,
        they don’t lie. You might be collecting the wrong numbers, making
        statistical errors, or misinterpreting the results, but the raw data
        itself is right. Qualitative metrics are notoriously easy for you to
        bias. If you’re not ruthlessly honest, you’ll hear what you want to
        hear in interviews. We love to believe what we already believe—and our
        subjects love to agree with us.</p></div><div class="sect1 pattern" title="How to Avoid Leading the Witness"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="pattern_how_to_avoid_leading_the_witness" style="clear: both">How to Avoid Leading the Witness</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1098"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1290"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1602"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1920"/>We’re a weak, shallow species. Human beings tend to tell
        you what they think you want to hear. We go along with the herd and
        side with the majority. This has disastrous effects on the results you
        get from respondents: you don’t want to make something nobody wants,
        but everybody lies about wanting it. What’s a founder to do?</p><p>You can’t change people’s fundamental nature. Response bias is a
        well-understood type of cognitive bias, exploited by political
        campaigners to get the answer they want by leading the witness (this
        is known as <span class="emphasis"><em>push polling</em></span>).</p><p>You can, however, do four things: don’t tip your hand, make the
        question real, keep digging, and look for other clues.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Don’t Tip Your Hand</strong></span></p><p>We’re surprisingly good at figuring out what someone else wants
        from us. The people you interview will do everything they can, at a
        subconscious level, to guess what you want them to say. They’ll pick
        up on a variety of cues.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Biased wording,</strong></span> such as
            “do you agree that...” is one such cue. This leads to an effect
            called <span class="emphasis"><em>acquiescence</em></span> bias, where a respondent
            will try to agree with the positive statement. You can get around
            this by asking people the <span class="emphasis"><em>opposite</em></span> of what
            you’re hoping they’ll say—if they are willing to disagree with you
            in order to express their need for a particular solution, that’s a
            stronger signal that you’ve found a problem worth solving.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>This is one reason why, early in the customer development
            process, open-ended questions are useful: they color the answers
            less and give the respondent a chance to ramble.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Preconceptions</strong></span> are
            another strong influencer. If the subject knows things about you,
            he’ll likely go along with them. For example, he’ll answer more
            positively to questions on the need for environmental protection
            if he knows you’re a vegetarian. The fewer things he knows about
            you, the less he’ll be able to skew things. Anonymity can be a
            useful asset here; this is a big reason to keep your mouth shut
            and let him talk, and to work from a standardized script.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Other social cues come from <span class="strong"><strong>appearance</strong></span>. Everything in your demeanor
            gives the respondent clues about how to answer you. These days,
            it’s probably hard for you to hide details about yourself,
            <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1114"/>since we live fairly transparently online and you
            may have met your respondents through social networks. But you’ll
            get better data if you dress blandly and act in a manner that
            doesn’t take strong positions or give off signals.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Make the Questions
        Real</strong></span></p><p>One way to get the real answer is to make the person
        uncomfortable.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>People only get really interesting when they start
          to rattle the bars of their cages.</em></span></p><div class="attribution"><p>—<span class="attribution">Alain de Botton, author and philosopher</span></p></div></blockquote></div><p>Next time you’re interviewing someone, instead of asking “Would
        you use this product?” (and getting a meaningless, but
        well-intentioned, “yes”), ask for a $100 pre-order payment. You’ll
        likely get a resounding “no.” And that’s where the interesting stuff
        starts.</p><p>Asking someone for money will definitely rattle her cage. Will
        it make both of you uncomfortable? Absolutely. Should you care? Not if
        you’re interested in building something people will actually pay
        for.</p><p>The more concrete you can make the question, the more real the
        answer. Get subjects to purchase, rather than indicating preference.
        Ask them to open their wallets. Get the names of five friends they’re
        sure will use the product, and request introductions. Suddenly,
        they’re invested. There’s a real cost to acting on your behalf. This
        discomfort will quickly wash away the need to be liked, and will show
        you how people really feel.</p><p>One other trick to overcome a subject’s desire to please an
        interviewer is to ask her how her friends would act. Asking “Do you
        smoke pot?” might make someone answer untruthfully to avoid moral
        criticism, but asking “What percentage of your friends smoke pot?” is
        likely to get an accurate answer that still reflects the person’s
        perception of the overall population.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Keep Digging</strong></span></p><p>A great trick for customer development interviews is to ask
        “why?” three times. It might make you sound like a two-year-old, but
        it works. Ask a question; wait for the person to finish. Pause for
        three seconds (which signals to her that you’re listening, and also
        makes sure she was really done). Then ask why.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1238"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1369"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1454"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1520"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1913"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1922"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2013"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2058"/>By asking “why?” several times, you force a respondent
        to explain the reasoning behind a statement. Often, the reasoning will
        be inconsistent or contradictory. That’s good—it means you’ve
        identified the gap between <span class="emphasis"><em>what people say they will do and
        what they will actually do</em></span>.</p><p>As an entrepreneur, you care about the latter; it’s hard to
        convince people to act against their inner, moral compasses. “Anyone
        who values truth,” says Jonathan Haidt, author of <span class="emphasis"><em>The
        Righteous Mind</em></span> (Pantheon), “should stop worshipping
        reason.” The reasoning of your interview subjects is far less
        interesting than their true beliefs and motivations.</p><p>You can also take a cue from interrogators and leave lingering,
        uncomfortable silences in the interview—your subject is likely to fill
        that empty air with useful, relevant insights or colorful anecdotes
        that can reveal a lot about her problems and needs.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Look for Other Clues</strong></span></p><p>Much of what people say isn’t verbal. While the amount of
        nonverbal communication has been widely overstated in popular
        research, body language often conveys feelings and emotions more than
        words do. Nervous tics and “tells” can reveal when someone is
        uncomfortable with a statement, or looking to another person for
        authority, for example.</p><p>When you’re interviewing someone, you need to be directly
        engaged with that person. Have a colleague tag along and take notes
        with you, and ask him to watch for nonverbal signals as well. This
        will help you build a bond with the subject and focus on her answers,
        and still capture important subliminal messages.</p><p>And never forget to ask the “Columbo” question. Like Peter
        Falk’s TV detective, save one disarming, unexpected question for the
        very end, after you’ve said your goodbyes. This will often catch
        people off guard, and can be used to confirm or repudiate something
        significant they’ve said in the interview.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Convergent and Divergent Problem Interviews"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="convergent_and_divergent_problem_intervi" style="clear: both">Convergent and Divergent Problem Interviews</h2></div></div></div><p>As we wrote this book, we tested out several ideas on
        entrepreneurs and blog readers. One of the more contentious ideas we
        discussed was that of scoring problem validation interviews. Several
        readers felt that this was a good idea, allowing them to understand
        how well their discovery of needs was proceeding and to rate the
        demand for a solution. Others protested, <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1254"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1317"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1664"/>sometimes vociferously: scoring was a bad idea, because
        it interfered with the open, speculative nature of this stage.</p><p>We’ll share our scoring framework later in the book. First,
        however, we’d like to propose a compromise: <span class="emphasis"><em>problem
        validation can actually happen in two distinct
        stages</em></span>.</p><p>While the goal of a problem interview is always the same—decide
        if you have enough information and confidence to move to the next
        stage—the tactics to achieve this do vary.</p><p>In Ash Maurya’s framework from earlier in this chapter, he
        suggests telling a story first to create context around the problem.
        Then he suggests introducing more specific problems and asking
        interviewees to rank them. This is a <span class="emphasis"><em>convergent</em></span>
        approach: it’s directed, focused, and intended to quantify the urgency
        and prevalence of the problems, so you can compare the many issues
        you’ve identified. In a convergent problem interview, you’re zeroing
        in on specifics—and while you want interviewees to speak freely, and
        the interviews aren’t heavily structured—you’re not on a fishing
        expedition with no idea what you’re fishing for.</p><p>A convergent problem interview gives you a clear course of
        action at the risk of focusing too narrowly on the problems that you
        think matter, rather than freeing interviewees to identify other
        problems that may be more important to them. For example, you might
        steer subjects back to your line of questioning at the expense of
        having them reveal an unexpected adjacent market or need.</p><p>On the other hand, a <span class="emphasis"><em>divergent</em></span> problem
        interview is much more speculative, intended to broaden your search
        for something useful you might go build. In this type of problem
        interview, you’re discussing a big problem space (healthcare, task
        management, transportation, booking a vacation, etc.) with
        interviewees, and letting them tell you what problems they have.
        You’re not suggesting problems and asking them to rank them. You
        probably have a problem or two that you’re looking to identify, and
        you’ll measure the success of the interviews, in part, by how often
        interviewees mention those problems (without you having done so
        first).</p><p>The risk with a divergent problem interview is that you venture
        too broadly on too many issues and never get interviewees to focus.
        Divergent problem interviews run the risk of giving you too many
        problems, or not enough similar problems, and no clarity on what to do
        next.</p><p>It takes practice to strike the right balance when doing
        interviews. On the one hand, you want to give interviewees the
        opportunity to tell you what they want, but you have to be ready to
        focus them when you think you’ve <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1255"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1372"/>found something worthwhile. At the same time, you
        shouldn’t hammer away at the problems you’re presenting if they’re not
        resonating.</p><p>If you’re just starting out, and really focused on an
        exploratory exercise, then try a divergent problem interview. Scoring
        in this case is less relevant. Collect initial feedback and see how
        many of the problems people freely described to you match up. If that
        goes well, you can move to convergent problem interviews with other
        people and see if the problems resonate at a larger scale.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="How Do I Know If the Problem Is Really Painful Enough?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="how_do_i_know_if_the_problem_is_really_p" style="clear: both">How Do I Know If the Problem Is Really Painful Enough?</h2></div></div></div><p>While the data you’ve collected to this point is qualitative,
        there are ways of helping you quantify that data to make an informed
        decision on whether you want to move forward or not. Ultimately, the
        One Metric That Matters here is
        <span class="emphasis"><em>pain</em></span>—specifically, your interviewees’ pain as it
        pertains to the problems you’ve shared with them. So how can you
        measure pain?</p><p>A simple approach is to score your problem interviews. This is
        not perfectly scientific; your scoring will be somewhat arbitrary, but
        if you have someone assisting you during the interviews and taking
        good notes it should be possible to score things consistently and get
        value out of this exercise.</p><p>There are a few criteria you can score against based on the
        questions you’ve asked in a convergent problem interview. Each answer
        has a weight; by adding the results up, you’ll have a sense of where
        you stand.</p><p>After completing each interview, ask yourself the following
        questions.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>1. Did the interviewee successfully rank the problems
        you presented?</em></span></p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="optiontable1a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="optiontable1"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989295.png"/></div></div><p>Even in a convergent problem interview where you’ve focused on a
        specific set of problems, the interview is open-ended enough to allow
        interviewees to discuss other issues. That’s completely fine, and is
        extremely important. There’s nothing that says the problems you’ve
        presented are the right ones—that’s precisely what you’re trying to
        measure and justify. So stay open-minded throughout the
        process.</p><p>For the purposes of scoring the interview and measuring pain, a
        bad score means the interview is a failure—the interviewee’s pain with
        the problems you’re considering isn’t substantial enough if she spends
        all her time talking about other problems she has. A failed interview
        is OK; it may lead you to something even more interesting and save you
        a lot of heartache.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>2. Is the interviewee actively trying to solve the
        problems, or has he done so in the past?</em></span></p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="optiontable2a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="optiontable2"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989296.png"/></div></div><p>The more effort the interviewee has put into trying to solve the
        problems you’re discussing, the better.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>3. Was the interviewee engaged and focused throughout
        the interview?</em></span></p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="optiontable3a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="optiontable3"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989297.png"/></div></div><p>Ideally, your interviewees were completely engaged in the
        process: listening, talking (being animated is a good thing), leaning
        forward, and so on. After enough interviews you’ll know the difference
        between someone who’s focused and engaged, and someone who is
        not.</p><p>The point totals for this question are lower than the previous
        two. For one, engagement in an interview is harder to measure; it’s
        more subjective than the other questions. We also don’t want to weigh
        engagement in the interview as heavily—it’s just not as important.
        Someone may seem somewhat disengaged but has spent the last five years
        trying to solve the problems you’re discussing. That’s someone with a
        lot of pain . . . maybe he’s just easily distracted.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1918"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2120"/><span class="emphasis"><em>4. Did the interviewee agree to a follow-up
        meeting/interview (where you’ll present your
        solution)?</em></span></p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="optiontable4a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="optiontable4"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989298.png"/></div></div><p>The goal of the problem interview is to discover a problem
        painful enough that you know people want it solved. And ideally, the
        people you’re speaking to are begging you for the solution. The next
        step in the process is the solution interview, so if you get there
        with people that’s a good sign.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>5. Did the interviewee offer to refer others to you
        for interviews?</em></span></p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="optiontable5a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="optiontable5"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989299.png"/></div></div><p>At the end of every interview, you should be asking for
        referrals to other interviewees. There’s a good chance the people your
        subjects recommend are similar in demographics and share the same
        problems.</p><p>Perhaps more importantly at this stage, you want to see if the
        subjects are willing to help out further by referring people in their
        network. This is a clear indicator that they don’t feel sheepish about
        introducing you, and that they think you’ll make them look smarter. If
        they found you annoying, they likely won’t suggest others you might
        speak with.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1960"/><span class="emphasis"><em>6. Did the interviewee offer to pay you
        immediately for the solution?</em></span></p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="optiontable6a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="optiontable6"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989300.png"/></div></div><p>Although having someone offer you money is more likely during
        the solution interviews (when you’re actually walking through the
        solution with people), this is still a good “gut check” moment. And
        certainly it’s a bonus if people are reaching for their
        wallets.</p><div class="sect2" title="Calculating the Scores"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="calculating_the_scores">Calculating the Scores</h3></div></div></div><p>A score of 31 or higher is a good score. Anything under is
          not. Try scoring all the interviews, and see how many have a good
          score. This is a decent indication of whether you’re onto something
          or not with the problems you want to solve. Then ask yourself what
          makes the good-score interviews different from the bad-score ones.
          Maybe you’ve identified a market segment, maybe you have better
          results when you dress well, maybe you shouldn’t do interviews in a
          coffee shop. <span class="emphasis"><em>Everything is an experiment you can learn
          from</em></span>.</p><p>You can also sum up the rankings for the problems that you
          presented. If you presented three problems, which one had the most
          first-place rankings? That’s where you’ll want to dig in further and
          start proposing solutions (during solution interviews).</p><p>The best-case scenario is very high interview scores within a
          subsection of interviewees where those interviewees all had the same
          (or very similar) rankings of the problems. That should give you
          <span class="emphasis"><em>more confidence</em></span> that you’ve found the right
          problem and the right market.</p></div></div><div class="sect1 case_study" title="Cloud9 IDE Interviews Existing Customers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_cloud9_ide_interviews_existin" style="clear: both">Cloud9 IDE Interviews Existing Customers</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1218"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1368"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1911"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1935"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2057"/>Cloud9 IDE is a cloud-based integrated development
        environment (IDE) that enables web and mobile developers to work
        together and collaborate in remote teams anywhere, anytime. The
        platform is primarily for JavaScript and Node.js applications, but
        it’s expanding to support other languages as well. The company has
        raised Series A financing from Accel and Atlassian.</p><p>Although the Cloud9 IDE team is well past the initial problem
        interview stage, they regularly speak with customers and engage in
        systematic customer development. Product Manager Ivar Pruijn says,
        “We’re close to product/market fit, and it helps us a great deal to
        speak with customers, understanding if we’re meeting their needs and
        how they’re using our product.”</p><p>Ivar took the scoring framework outlined previously and modified
        some of the questions for the types of interviews he was doing. “Since
        we’re now speaking with customers using our product, we asked slightly
        different questions, but we scored them just the same,” he says. The
        first two questions that Ivar asked himself after conducting an
        interview were:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Did the interviewee mention problems in his/her workflow
            that our product solves or will solve soon?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Is the interviewee actively trying to solve the problems our
            product solves/will solve soon, or has he/she done so in the
            past?</p></li></ol></div><p>“With these questions, we’re trying to determine how well we’re
        solving problems for actual customers. If many of the scores would
        have been low, we would have known something was wrong,” he
        says.</p><p>Happily, most of the interview scores were good, but Ivar was
        able to dig deeper and learn more. “I was able to identify the
        customer types to focus on for product improvements. I noticed that
        two specific customer segments scored the highest on the interviews,
        especially the first two scoring criteria about meeting their needs
        and solving their problems.”</p><p>After scoring the initial interviews, Ivar then verified the
        results and the scoring in two ways. First, he interviewed some of the
        company’s top active users, gaining an in-depth knowledge of how they
        work. Second, he analyzed the data warehouse, which has information on
        how the product is being used. Both of these confirmed his initial
        findings: two <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1383"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1919"/>specific segments of customers were getting
        significantly more value from the product. “Interestingly, both of
        these customer groups weren’t the initial ones we were going after,”
        he says. “So now we know where we can invest more of our time and
        energy.”</p><p>In this case, open-ended discussions followed by scoring—even
        when the company was beyond the initial Empathy stage—revealed a
        market segment that had better stickiness and was ripe for rapid
        growth. What’s more, Ivar says that scoring the interview questions
        helped him improve his interviewing over time, focusing on results
        that could be acted upon.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Cloud9 IDE decided to run scored customer interviews even

        when a lot of people are already trying to solve it or have tried to
        do so in the past. People will go to amazing lengths to solve really
        painful problems that matter to them. Typically, they’re using another
        product that wasn’t meant to solve their problem, but it’s “good
        enough,” or they’ve built something themselves. Even though you’re
        doing qualitative interviews, you can still crunch some numbers
        afterward:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>How many people aren’t trying to solve the problem at all?
            If people haven’t really made an attempt to solve the problem, you
            have to be very cautious about moving forward. You’ll have to make
            them aware of the problem in the first place.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1387"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1915"/>How many volunteer a solution that’s “good enough”?
            You’ll spend more time on solutions when you do solution
            interviews, but startups regularly underestimate the power of
            “good enough.” Mismatched socks are a universal problem nobody’s
            getting rich fixing.</p></li></ul></div><p>Too often, idealistic startups underestimate a market’s inertia.
        They attack market leaders with features, functionality, and
        strategies that aren’t meaningful enough to customers. Their MVP has
        too much “minimum” to provoke a change. They assume that what they’re
        doing—whether it’s a slicker UI, simpler system, social functionality,
        or something else—is an obvious win. Then “good enough” bites them in
        the ass.</p><p>The bar for startups to succeed at any real scale is much higher
        than that of the market leaders. The market leaders are already there,
        and even if they’re losing ground, it’s generally at a slow pace.
        Startups need to scale as quickly as possible. You have to be 10 times
        better than the market leader before anyone will really notice, which
        means you have to be 100 times more creative, strategic, sneaky, and
        aggressive. Market leaders may be losing touch with their customers,
        but they still know them better than anyone else.</p><p>You need to work much harder to win customers from incumbents.
        Don’t just look at the “obvious” flaws of the incumbents (like an
        outdated design) and assume that’s what needs fixing. You’ll have to
        dig far deeper in order to find the real customer pain points and make
        sure you address them quickly and successfully.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Are There Enough People Who Care About This Problem?

        step is to understand the market size and potential. Remember, one
        customer isn’t a market, and you have to be careful about solving a
        problem that too few people genuinely care about.</p><p>If you’re trying to estimate the size of a market, it’s a good
        idea to do both a top-down and a bottom-up analysis, and compare the
        results. This helps to check your math.</p><p>A top-down analysis starts with a big number and breaks it into
        smaller parts. A bottom-up one does the reverse. Consider, for
        example, a restaurant in New York City.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>A top-down model would look at the total money people spend
            dining out in the US, then the percentage of that in New York,
            then the number of restaurants in the city, and finally calculate
            the revenues for a single restaurant.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1366"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1916"/>A bottom-up model would look at the number of tables
            in a restaurant, the percent that are occupied, and the average
            price per party. Then it would multiply this by days of the year
            (adjusting for seasonality).</p></li></ul></div><p>This is an oversimplification—there are plenty of other factors
        to consider such as location, type of restaurant, and so on. But the
        end result should provide two estimates of annual revenue. If they’re
        wildly different, something is wrong with your business model.</p><p>As you’re conducting problem interviews, remember to ask enough
        demographic-type questions to understand who the interviewees are. The
        questions you’ll ask will depend a great deal on who you’re speaking
        to and the type of business you’re starting. If you’re going after a
        business market, you’ll want to know more about a person’s position in
        the company, buying power, budgeting, seasonal influences, and
        industry. If you’re going after a consumer, you’re much more
        interested in lifestyle, interests, social circles, and so on.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="What Will It Take to Make Them Aware of the Problem?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="what_will_it_take_to_make_them_aware_of" style="clear: both">What Will It Take to Make Them Aware of the Problem?</h2></div></div></div><p>If the subjects don’t know they have the problem—but you have
        good evidence that the need really exists—then you need to understand
        how easily they’ll come to realize it, and the vectors of
        awareness.</p><p>Be careful. Most of the time, when people don’t have a problem,
        they’ll still agree with you. They don’t want to hurt your feelings.
        To be nice, they’ll pretend they have the problem once you alert them
        to it. If you’re convinced that people have the problem—and just need
        to be made aware of it—you need to find ways to test that
        assumption.</p><p>Some ways to get a more honest answer from people are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Get them a prototype early on.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use paper prototyping, or a really simple mockup in
            PowerPoint, Keynote, or Balsamiq, to watch how they interact with
            your idea without coaching.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>See if they’ll pay immediately.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Watch them explain it to their friends and see if they
            understand how to spread the message.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Ask for referrals to others who might care.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect1" title="A “Day in the Life” of Your Customer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="quotation_markday_in_the_lifequotation_m" style="clear: both">A “Day in the Life” of Your Customer</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1386"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1923"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2165"/>During problem interviews, you want to get a deep
        understanding of your customer. We mentioned collecting demographics
        earlier and looking for ways to bucket customers into different
        groups, but you can take this a step further and gain a lot more
        insight. You can get inside their heads.</p><p>Customers are people. They lead lives. They have kids, they eat
        too much, they don’t sleep well, they phone in sick, they get bored,
        they watch too much reality TV. If you’re building for some kind of
        idealized, economically rational buyer, you’ll fail. But if you know
        your customers, warts and all, and you build things that naturally fit
        into their lives, they’ll love you.</p><p>To do this, you need to infiltrate your customer’s daily life.
        Don’t think of “infiltrate” as a bad word. In order for you to
        succeed, customers need to use your application; if you want them to
        do so, you need to slot yourself into their lives in an effortless,
        seamless way. Understanding customers’ daily lives means you can map
        out everything they do, and when they do it. With the right approach,
        you’ll start to understand <span class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span> as well. You’ll
        identify influences (bosses, friends, family members, employees,
        etc.), limitations, constraints, and opportunities.</p><p>One tactic for mapping this out is a “day in the life”
        storyboard. A storyboard is visual—it’s going to involve lots of
        multicolored sticky notes plastered on the wall—and it allows you to
        navigate through a customer’s life and figure out where your solution
        will have the most impact. <a class="xref" href="ch15.html#how_highscore_house_mapped_the_chaos_of" title="Figure 15-1. How HighScore House mapped the chaos of parenting">Figure 15-1</a> shows an example
        of a storyboard.</p><p>Having this map in place makes it much easier to come up with
        good hypotheses around how, when, and by whom your solution will be
        used. You can experiment with different tactics for interrupting users
        and infiltrating their lives. The right level of positive access will
        allow to use your product successfully..</p><p>Mapping a day in the life of your customer will also reveal
        obvious holes in your understanding of your customer, and those are
        areas of risk you may want to tackle quickly. With a clearer
        understanding of when and how your solution will be used, you have a
        better chance of defining a minimum viable product feature set that
        hits the mark.</p><p>The “day in the life” exercise is a way of describing a very
        detailed, human use case for your solution that goes beyond simply
        defining target markets and customer segments. After all, you’ll be
        selling to people. You need to know how to reach them, interrupt them,
        and make a difference in their lives at the exact moment when they
        need your solution.</p><div class="figure"><a id="how_highscore_house_mapped_the_chaos_of"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00034"/><img alt="How HighScore House mapped the chaos of parenting" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989301.png.jpg"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 15-1. How HighScore House mapped the chaos of parenting</div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1525"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2346"/>User experience designers also rely on mental models of
        their users to understand how people think about something. A mental
        model is simply the mental representation of something in the real
        world—often a simplified version of reality that helps someone work
        with a thing. Sometimes these are metaphors—the recycle bin on a
        computer, for example. Other times, they’re simple, fundamental
        patterns that live deep down in our reptile brains—team allegiance, or
        xenophobia.</p><p>Adaptive Path co-founder Indi Young has written extensively
        about mental models, developing a number of ways to link your
        customers’ lives and patterns with the products, services, and
        interactions you have with them.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch15fn01" id="ch15fn01">51</a>]</sup> <a class="xref" href="ch15.html#overanalyzing_the_dayapostrophes_ablutio" title="Figure 15-2. Overanalyzing the day’s ablutions with a mental model">Figure 15-2</a> shows an example

        particular task, then aligning your activities and features with those
        behaviors, is a good way to identify missed opportunities to improve
        engagement, upsell, endorse, or otherwise influence your buyers. If
        you’re making a personal fitness tool, timing interactions with gym
        visits, holiday binges, and morning ablutions lets you create a more
        tailored, engaging experience.</p></div><div class="sect1 pattern" title="Finding People to Talk To"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="pattern_finding_people_to_talk_to" style="clear: both">Finding People to Talk To</h2></div></div></div><p>The modern world isn’t inclined to physical interaction.

        joined the TechStars Seattle accelerator program in 2011. But it
        wasn’t an easy road. Founder Nick Soman says that at first Andy Sack,
        managing director of the Seattle program, rejected LikeBright, saying,
        “We don’t think you understand your customer well enough.”</p><p>With the application deadline looming, Andy gave Nick a
        challenge: go speak to 100 single women about their frustrations with
        dating, and then tell TechStars what he’d learned.</p><p>Nick was stuck. How was he going to speak with that many women
        quickly enough? He didn’t think it was possible, at least not easily.
        And then he decided to run an experiment with Mechanical
        Turk.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch15fn03" id="ch15fn03">53</a>]</sup></p><p>Mechanical Turk is a service provided by Amazon that allows you
        to pay small amounts of money for people to complete simple tasks.
        It’s often used to get quick feedback on things like logos and color
        choices, or to perform small tasks such as tagging a picture or
        flagging spam.</p><p>The idea was to use Mechanical Turk to survey 100 single women,
        putting out a task (or what Mechanical Turk calls a HIT) asking women
        (who fit a particular profile) to call Nick. In exchange he paid them
        $2. The interviews typically lasted 10–15 minutes.</p><p>“In my research, I found that there’s a good cross-section of
        people on Mechanical Turk,” says Nick. “We found lots of highly
        educated, diverse women that were very willing to speak with us about
        their dating experiences.”</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1501"/>Nick set up several Google Voice phone numbers
        (throwaway numbers that couldn’t be tracked or reused) and recruited a
        few friends to help him out.</p><p>He prepared a simple interview script with open-ended questions,
        since he was digging into the problem validation stage of his startup.
        Nick says, “I was amazed at the feedback I got. We were able to speak
        with 100 single women that met our criteria in four hours on one
        evening.”</p><p>As a result, Nick gained incredible insight into LikeBright’s
        potential customers and the challenges he would face building the
        startup. He went back to TechStars and Andy Sack with that know-how
        and impressed them enough to get accepted. LikeBright’s website is now
        live with a 50% female user base, and recently raised a round of
        funding. Nick remains a fan of Mechanical Turk. “Since that first
        foray into interviewing customers, I’ve probably spoken with over
        1,000 people through Mechanical Turk,” he says.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>LikeBright used a technical solution to talk to many end

        technology to dramatically improve the efficiency of collecting that
        data. In the Empathy stage, focus on building tools for getting good
        feedback quickly from many people. Just because customer development
        isn’t code doesn’t mean you shouldn’t invest heavily in it.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1027"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1449"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1492"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1629"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2114"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2175"/>LikeBright chose Mechanical Turk to reach people at
        scale, but there are plenty of other tools. Surveys can be effective,
        assuming you’ve done enough customer development already to know what
        questions to ask. The challenge with surveys is finding people to
        answer them. Unlike the one-to-one interviews you’ve been conducting
        so far, here you need to automate the task and deal with the
        inevitable statistical noise.</p><p>If you have a social following or access to a mailing list, you
        can start there, but often, you’re trying to find new people to speak
        with. They’re new sources of information, and they’re less likely to
        be biased. That means reaching out to groups with whom you aren’t
        already in touch, ideally through software, so you’re not curating
        each invitation by hand.</p><p>Facebook has an advertising platform for reaching very targeted
        groups of people. You can segment your audience by demographics,
        interests, and more. Although the click-through rate on Facebook ads
        is extremely low, you’re not necessarily looking for volume at this
        stage. Finding 20 or 30 people to speak with is a great start, plus
        you can test messaging this way, through the ads you publish, as well
        as the subsequent landing pages you have to encourage people to
        connect with you.</p><p>You can advertise on LinkedIn to very targeted audiences. This
        will cost you some money, but if you’ve identified a good audience of
        people through searching LinkedIn contacts and groups, you might
        consider testing some early messaging through its ad platform.</p><p>Google makes it really easy to target campaigns. If you want to
        promote a survey or signup on the Web, you can do so with remarkable
        precision. In the first step of setting up an AdWords campaign, you
        get to specify the location, language, and other information that
        targets the ad, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch15.html#some_of_the_ways_you_can_control_who_see" title="Figure 15-7. Some of the ways you can control who sees your ad">Figure 15-7</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="some_of_the_ways_you_can_control_who_see"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00040"/><img alt="Some of the ways you can control who sees your ad" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989307.png.jpg"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 15-7. Some of the ways you can control who sees your ad</div></div><p>Once you’ve done that, you can create your message, using a
        screen like the one in <a class="xref" href="ch15.html#would_you_click_on_these_adsquestion_mar" title="Figure 15-8. Would you click on these ads?">Figure 15-8</a>. This is an
        excellent way to try out different taglines and approaches: even the

        Consumer Surveys, that’s specifically designed to collect consumer
        information.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch15fn04" id="ch15fn04">54</a>]</sup> Because of the wide reach of Google’s publishing and
        advertising network, the company can generate results that are
        statistically representative of segments of the population as a
        whole.</p><p>Google’s technique uses a “survey wall” approach, but by
        simplifying the survey process to individual questions requiring only
        a click or two, the company achieves a 23.1% response rate (compared
        to less than 1% for “intercept” surveys, 7–14% for phone surveys, and
        15% for Internet panels).<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch15fn05" id="ch15fn05">55</a>]</sup> However, because of the quick-response format, it’s hard

        survey design, testing, distribution, and analysis. But before you do
        any of these, know why you’re asking the questions in the first place.
        Lean is all about identifying and quantifying the risk. What kind of
        uncertainty are you trying to quantify by doing a survey?</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>If you’re asking what existing brands come to mind in a

        questions will change your behavior</em></span>. In other words, draw a
        line in the sand before you run the survey. Your earlier problem
        interviews showed you an opportunity; now, you’re checking to see
        whether that opportunity exists in the market as a whole. For each
        quantifiable question, decide what would be a “good” score. Write it
        down somewhere so you’ll remember.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Survey Design</strong></span></p><p>Your survey should include three kinds of questions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Demographics and psychographics you can use to segment the
            responses, such as age, gender, or Internet usage.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Quantifiable questions that you can analyze statistically,
            such as ratings, agreement or disagreement with a statement, or
            selecting something from a list.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Open-ended questions that allow respondents to add
            qualitative data.</p></li></ul></div><p>Always ask the segmentation questions up front and the
        open-ended ones at the end. That way you know if your sample was
        representative of the market you’re targeting, and if people don’t
        finish the last questions, you still have enough quantitative
        responses to generate results in which you can be confident.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1022"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1205"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1301"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1647"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2180"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2195"/><span class="strong"><strong>Test the
        Survey</strong></span></p><p>Before sending it out, try the survey on people who haven’t seen
        it. You’ll almost always find they get stuck or don’t understand
        something. You’re not ready to send the survey out until at least
        three people who haven’t seen it, and are in your target market, can
        complete it without questions and then <span class="emphasis"><em>explain to you what
        each question meant</em></span>. This is no exaggeration: everyone gets
        surveys wrong.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Send the Survey Out</strong></span></p><p>You want to reach people you don’t know. You could tweet out a
        link to the survey form or landing page, but you’ll naturally get
        respondents who are in your extended social circle. This is a time
        when it makes sense to pay for access to a new audience.</p><p>Design several ads that link to the survey. They can take
        several forms:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Name the audience you’re
            targeting.</strong></span> (“Are you a single mom? Take this brief
            survey and help us address a big challenge.”)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Mention the problem you’re dealing
            with.</strong></span> (“Can’t sleep? We’re trying to fix that, and want
            your input.”)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Mention the solution or your unique

            accounting software automatically finds tax breaks. Help us plan
            the product roadmap.”) Be careful not to lead the witness; don’t
            use this if you’re still trying to settle on positioning.</p></li></ul></div><p>Remember, too, that the first question you’re asking is “Was my
        message compelling enough to convince them to take the survey?” You’re
        trying out a number of different value propositions. In some cases,
        you don’t even care about a survey—we know one entrepreneur who tried
        out various taglines, all of which pointed to a spam site. All he
        needed to know was which one got the most clicks, and he didn’t want
        to tell anyone who he was yet.</p><p>You can also use mailing lists. Some user groups or newsletters
        may be willing to feature you on their page or in a mail-out if what
        you’re doing is relevant to their audience.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Collect the
        Information</strong></span></p><p>When you run the survey, measure your cost per completed
        response. Do a small test of a few dozen responses first. If your
        numbers are low, check whether people are abandoning on a particular
        form field—some analytics tools like ClickTale let you do this. Then
        remove that field <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1890"/>and see if completion rates go up. You can also try
        breaking up the survey into smaller ones, asking fewer questions, or
        changing your call to action.</p><p>While you’re collecting information, don’t forget to also
        request permission to contact respondents and collect contact
        information. If you’ve found a workable solution to a real problem,
        some of them may become your beta customers.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Analyze the Data</strong></span></p><p>Finally, crunch the data properly. You’re actually looking at

          the rest have the individual responses that particular respondents

          another—for example, do men play more video games than women? That’s
          what a pivot table is for. First, you tell the pivot table where to
          get the source data, then you specify the dimension by which to
          segment, and then you set what kind of computation you want (such as
          the average, the maximum value, or the standard deviation) as shown
          here:</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col class="c1"/><col class="c2"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td style="vertical-align: top; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Gender</p></td><td style="vertical-align: top; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>Total</p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>F</p></td><td style="vertical-align: top; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>7.57</p></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align: top; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>M</p></td><td style="vertical-align: top; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; "><p>10.33</p></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align: top; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><p><span class="strong"><strong>Grand

        locations. Whenever you have a question that’s relevant to a
        location—whether that’s a specific place or an area—you can use
        Localmind to get an answer. You send the question out through the
        mobile application, and people answer.</p><p>Before writing a line of code, Localmind was concerned that
        people would never answer questions. The company felt this was a huge
        risk; if questions went unanswered, users would have a terrible
        experience and stop using Localmind. But how could it prove (or
        disprove) that people would answer questions from strangers without
        building the app?</p><p>The team looked to Twitter and ran an experiment. Tracking
        geolocated tweets (primarily in Times Square, because there were lots
        of them there over several days), they sent @ messages to people who
        had just tweeted. The messages would be questions about the area: how
        busy is it, is the subway running on time, is something open, etc.
        These were the types of questions they believed people would ask
        through Localmind.</p><p>The response rate to their tweeted questions was very high. This
        gave the team the confidence to assume that people would answer
        questions about where they were, even if they didn’t know who was
        asking. Even though Twitter wasn’t the “perfect system” for this kind
        of test because <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1200"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1382"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1763"/>there were lots of variables (e.g., the team didn’t know
        if people would get a push notification on a tweet to them or notice
        the tweet), it was a good enough proxy to de-risk the solution, and
        convince the team that it was worth building Localmind.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Localmind identified a big risk in its plan—whether people

        functionality to test the risks you’ve identified in the Empathy
        stage—you’ll continue to gather feedback (in the form of surveys) and
        acquire early adopters (through a beta enrollment site, social media,
        and other forms of teasing). In this way, by the time you launch the
        MVP you’ll have a critical mass of testers and early adopters eager to
        give you feedback. You’re farming test subjects. Your OMTM at this
        point is enrollments, social reach, and other indicators that you’ll
        be able to drive actual users to your MVP so you can learn and iterate
        quickly. This is the reverse <span class="emphasis"><em>Field of Dreams</em></span>
        moment: <span class="emphasis"><em>if they come, you will build it</em></span>.</p><p>It’s hard to decide how good your minimum product should be. On
        the one hand, time is precious, and you need to cut things ruthlessly.
        On the other hand, you want users to have an “aha!” moment, that sense
        of having discovered something important and memorable worth solving.

        “hacks,” and decide what feature set to launch for your MVP.</p><p>The MVP has to generate the value you’ve promised to users and
        customers. If it’s too shallow, people will be disinterested and
        disappointed. If it’s too bloated, people will be confused and
        frustrated. In both cases, you’ll fail.</p><p>It’s important to contrast an MVP with a smoke-test approach
        where you build a teaser site—for example, a simple page generated in
        LaunchRock with links to social networks. With a smoke-test page,
        you’re testing the risk that the message isn’t compelling enough to
        get signups. With the MVP, you’re testing the risk that the product
        won’t solve a need that people want solved in a way that will make
        them permanently change their behavior. The former tests the problem
        messaging; the latter, the solution effectiveness.</p><p>Circle back with interviewees as you’re designing the MVP. Show
        them wireframes, prototypes, and mockups. Make sure you get the
        strong, positive reaction you’re looking for before building anything.
        Cut everything out that doesn’t draw an extremely straight line, from
        your validated problem, to the unique value proposition, to the MVP,
        to the metrics you’ll use to validate success.</p><p>It’s important to note that the MVP is a process, not a product.
        This is something we learned at Year One Labs working with multiple
        startups all at a similar stage. The knee-jerk reaction once you’ve
        decided on the feature set is to build it and gun for traction as
        quickly as possible, turning on all the marketing tactics possible. As
        much as we all understand that seeing our name in lights on a popular
        tech blog doesn’t really make a huge difference, it’s still great when
        it’s there. But sticking with Lean Startup’s core
        tenet—<span class="emphasis"><em>build</em></span>→<span class="emphasis"><em>measure</em></span>→<span class="emphasis"><em>learn</em></span>—it’s
        important to realize that an MVP will go through numerous iterations
        before you’re ready to go to the next step.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Measuring the MVP"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="measuring_the_mvp" style="clear: both">Measuring the MVP</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1459"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1772"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1832"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2017"/>The real analytical work starts the minute you develop
        and launch an MVP, because every interaction between a customer and
        the MVP results in data you can analyze.</p><p>For starters, you need to pick the OMTM. If you don’t know what
        it should be, and you haven’t defined “success” for that metric, you
        shouldn’t be building anything. Everything you build into the initial
        MVP should relate to and impact the OMTM. And the line in the sand has
        to be clearly drawn.</p><p>At this stage, metrics around user acquisition are irrelevant.
        You don’t need hundreds of thousands of users to prove if something is
        working or not. You don’t even need thousands. Even with the most
        complicated of businesses, you can narrow things down
        significantly:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>If you’re building a marketplace for used goods, you might
            focus on one tiny geographic area, such as house listings in
            Miami.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The same holds true for any location-based application where
            density is important—a garage sale finder that’s limited to one or
            two neighborhoods.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You might pick one product type for your marketplace
            test—say, X-Men comics from the 80s—validate the business there,
            and then expand.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Maybe you want to test the core game mechanics of your game.

            if it works in a single school.</p></li></ul></div><p>The key is to identify the riskiest parts of your business and
        de-risk them through a constant cycle of testing and learning. Metrics
        is how you measure and learn whether the risk has been
        overcome.</p><p>Entrepreneur, author, and investor Tim Ferriss, in an interview
        with Kevin Rose, said that if you focus on making 10,000 people really
        happy, you could reach millions later.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch15fn06" id="ch15fn06">56</a>]</sup> For the first launch of your MVP, you can think even
        smaller, but Ferriss’s point is absolutely correct: total focus is
        necessary in order to make genuine progress.</p><p>The most important metrics will be around engagement.
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Are people using the product? How are they using the
        product? Are they using all of the product or only pieces of it? Is
        their usage and behavior as expected or different?</em></span></p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1944"/>No feature should be built without a corresponding
        metric on usage and engagement. These sub-metrics all bubble up to the
        OMTM; they’re pieces of data that, aggregated, tell a more complete
        story. If you can’t instrument a feature or component of your product,
        be very careful about adding it in—you’re introducing variables that
        will become harder and harder to control.</p><p>Even as you focus on a single metric, you need to be sure you’re
        actually adding value. Let’s say you launch a new SaaS product, and
        you assume that if someone doesn’t use it in 30 days, he’s churned.
        That means it’ll be 30 days before you know your churn rate. That’s
        much too long. Customers always churn, but if you’re not writing them
        off quickly, you may think you have more engagement than you really
        do. Even if initial engagement is strong, you need to measure whether
        you’re delivering value. You might, for example, look at the time
        between visits. Is it the same? Or does it gradually drop off? You
        might find a useful leading indicator along the way.</p><div class="sect2" title="Don’t Ignore Qualitative Analytics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="donapostrophet_ignore_qualitative_analyt">Don’t Ignore Qualitative Analytics</h3></div></div></div><p>You should be speaking with users and customers throughout the
          MVP process. Now that they have a product in their hands, you can
          learn a great deal from them. They’ll be less inclined to lie or
          sugarcoat things—after all, you made a promise of some kind and now
          they have a high expectation that you’ll deliver. Early adopters are
          forgiving, and they’re OK with (and in fact, crave) roughly hewn
          products, but at the same time their feedback will become more
          honest and transparent as their time with the MVP increases.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Be Prepared to Kill Features"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="be_prepared_to_kill_features">Be Prepared to Kill Features</h3></div></div></div><p>It’s incredibly hard to do, but it can make a huge difference.
          If a feature isn’t being used, or it’s not creating value through
          its use, get rid of it and see what happens. Once you’ve removed a
          feature, continue to measure engagement and usage with existing
          users. <span class="emphasis"><em>Did it make a difference?</em></span></p><p>If nobody minds, you’ve cleaned things up. If the existing
          users protest, you may need to revisit your decision. And if a new
          cohort of users—who’d never seen the feature before it was
          removed—start asking for it, they may represent a new segment with
          different needs than your existing user base.</p><p>The narrowing of your focus and value proposition through the
          elimination of features should have an impact on how customers
          respond.</p></div></div><div class="sect1 case_study" title="Static Pixels Eliminates a Step in Its Order Process"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_static_pixels_eliminates_a_st" style="clear: both">Static Pixels Eliminates a Step in Its Order Process</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1384"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1456"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1546"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2139"/>Static Pixels is an early-stage startup founded by
        Massimo Farina. The company allows you to order prints of your
        Instagram photos on recycled cardboard. When the company first
        launched, it had a feature called InstaOrder, which allowed you to
        order photos directly from Instagram. Massimo believed that InstaOrder
        would make it easier for customers to use his service and increase the
        volume of orders. “We built the feature based on pre-launch feedback,
        and the assumption that users would like it,” Massimo said.</p><p>The company spent two weeks building the feature—a costly amount
        of development time for a small team—but after releasing the feature
        found it wasn’t used much. Massimo said, “Turns out, the feature was
        confusing people and making the checkout process more
        complicated.”</p><p>As <a class="xref" href="ch15.html#which_model_worked_betterquestion_mark" title="Figure 15-9. Which model worked better?">Figure 15-9</a>
        shows, the first-time ordering process with InstaOrder had an extra
        step, and that step required going to PayPal to pre-authorize
        payments. The hypothesis was that the feature would be worth the
        first-time ordering pain, after which ordering would be much easier
        directly through Instagram. “Convenience was the hypothesis,” noted
        Massimo.</p><p>But Massimo and his team were wrong. Not only were orders low,
        but page views started to drop on the landing page that promoted the
        feature, and bounce rate was high as well. It just wasn’t
        resonating.</p><p>Two weeks after the feature was removed, the number of
        transactions doubled, and it continues to increase. The bounce rate on
        the new landing page improved while sign-in goal completions
        increased.</p><p>So what did the Static Pixels team learn? “For starters, I think
        people didn’t transact through Instagram because it’s a very new and
        foreign process,” Massimo said. “Ordering products via a native social
        platform interface hasn’t really been done before. Also, I believe
        that when people are posting photos to Instagram, they aren’t
        necessarily thinking about ordering prints of that photo.”</p><p>The company lost some development time, but through a focus on
        analytics—particularly on its key metric of prints ordered—it
        identified roadblocks in its process, made tough decisions on removing
        a feature (which it originally thought was one of its unique value
        propositions), and then tracked the results.</p><div class="figure"><a id="which_model_worked_betterquestion_mark"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00042"/><img alt="Which model worked better?" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989309.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 15-9. Which model worked better?</div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The way Static Pixels asked users to buy had too much

        first-purchase simplicity for long-term ease of repeat purchases
        seemed like a good idea, but it was premature. This early in the
        company’s life, the question was “Will people buy prints?” and not
        “Will we have loyal buyers?” The feature the team had built was
        de-risking the wrong question. Always know what risk you’re
        eliminating, and then design the minimum functionality to measure
        whether you’ve overcome it.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="A Summary of the Empathy Stage"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="summary_of_the_empathy_stage" style="clear: both">A Summary of the Empathy Stage</h2></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1375"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1385"/>Your goal is to identify a need you can solve in a
