    producing bumper stickers. Odds are, if you’re reading this, you know some
    of our most popular additions to the business lexicon: pivot, minimum
    viable product, Build-Measure-Learn, continuous deployment, or Steve
    Blank’s famous “get out of the building.” Some of these you can already
    buy on a t-shirt.</p><p>Given that the past few years of my life have been dedicated to
    promoting these concepts, I am not now trying to diminish their
    importance. We are living through a transformation in the way work is
    done, and these concepts are key elements of that change. The Lean Series
    is dedicated to bringing this transformation to life by moving beyond the
    bumper stickers and diving deep into the details.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Lean Analytics</em></span> takes this mission to a whole
    new level.</p><p>On the surface, this new world seems exciting and bold. Innovation,
    new sources of growth, the glory of product/market fit and the agony of
    failures and pivots all make for riveting drama. But all of this work
    rests on a foundation made of far more boring stuff: accounting, math, and
    metrics. And the traditional accounting metrics—when applied to the
    uncertainties of innovation—are surprisingly dangerous. We call them
    vanity metrics, the numbers that make you feel good but seriously mislead.
    Avoiding them requires a whole new accounting discipline, which I call
    “innovation accounting.”</p><p>Trust me, as an entrepreneur, I had no interest in accounting as a
    subject. To be honest, in far too many of my companies, the accounting was
    incredibly simple anyway: revenue, margins, free cash flows—they were all
    zero.</p><p>But accounting is at the heart of our modern management techniques.
    Since the days of Frederick Winslow Taylor, we have assessed the skill of
    managers by comparing their results to the forecast. Beat the plan, get a
    promotion. Miss the plan, and your stock price declines. And for some
    kinds of products, this works just fine. Accurate forecasting requires a
    long and stable operating history from which to make the forecast. The
    longer and more stable, the more accurate.</p><p>And yet who really feels like the world is getting more and more
    stable every day? Whenever conditions change, or we attempt to change them
    by introducing a truly new product, accurate forecasting becomes nearly
    impossible. And without that yardstick, how do we evaluate if we’re making
    progress? If we’re busy building the wrong product, why should we be proud
    to be doing it on time and on budget? This is the reason we need a new
    understanding of how to measure progress, both for ourselves as
    entrepreneurs and managers, as investors in the companies we fund, and the
    teams under our purview.</p><p>That is why an accounting revolution is required if we’re to succeed
    in this new era of work. And Ben and Alistair have done the incredibly
    hard work of surveying the best thinking on the metrics and analytics,
    gathering in-depth examples, and breaking new ground in presenting their
    own frameworks for figuring out which metrics matter, and when. Their work
    collecting industry-wide benchmarks to use for a variety of key metrics is
    worth the price of admission all by itself.</p><p>This is not a theoretical work, but a guide for all practitioners
    who seek new sources of growth. I wish you happy hunting.</p><p>Eric Ries</p><p>San Francisco</p><p>February 4, 2013</p></section></body></html>
