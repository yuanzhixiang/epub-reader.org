    entrepreneur, author, and public speaker for nearly 20 years. In that
    time, he’s worked on web performance, big data, cloud computing, and
    startups. Alistair is the chair of O’Reilly’s Strata conference, TechWeb’s
    Cloud Connect, and Interop’s Enterprise Cloud Summit. In 2001, he
    co-founded web performance startup Coradiant, and since that time has also
    helped launch Rednod, CloudOps, Bitcurrent, Year One Labs, the Bitnorth
    Conference, the International Startup Festival, and several early-stage
    companies.</p><p>This is Alistair’s fourth book on analytics, technology, and
    entrepreneurship. Alistair lives in Montreal, Canada, and tries to
    mitigate chronic attention deficit disorder by writing about far too many
    things at <span class="emphasis"><em>Solve for Interesting</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.solveforinteresting.com" target="_top">http://www.solveforinteresting.com</a></em></span>). You can
    find him on Twitter as @acroll, or email him at
    <span class="emphasis"><em>alistair@solveforinteresting.com</em></span>.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Ben Yoskovitz</strong></span> is an entrepreneur
    with more than 15 years of experience in web businesses. He started his
    first company in 1996 while completing university. In 2011, he joined
    GoInstant as VP Product. The company was acquired in September 2012 by
    Salesforce.com, and he continues in his role with GoInstant and
    Salesforce.com.</p><p>Ben has been blogging since 2006. His <span class="emphasis"><em>Instigator
    Blog</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://instigatorblog.com" target="_top">http://instigatorblog.com</a></em></span>) is recognized as one
    of the top blogs on startups and entrepreneurship. Ben is also an active
    mentor to numerous startups and accelerator programs. He regularly speaks
    at startup conferences and events, including the Michigan Lean Startup
    Conference, the Internet Marketing Conference, and the Lean Startup
    Conference. You can reach him on Twitter as @byosko, or email him at
    <span class="emphasis"><em>byosko@gmail.com</em></span>.</p><p>In 2010, Alistair, Ben, and two other partners co-founded Year One
    Labs, an early-stage accelerator that provided funding and up to one year
    of hands-on mentorship to five startups. Year One Labs followed a Lean
    Startup program, making it the first accelerator to formalize such a
    structure. Four of those five companies graduated from Year One Labs, and
    three went on to raise follow-on financing. One of those companies,
    Localmind, was acquired by Airbnb. A great deal of Alistair and Ben’s
    experience and thinking around Lean Startup and analytics emerged during
    this time.</p></section></body></html>
