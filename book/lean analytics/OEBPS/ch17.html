      first used the term <span class="emphasis"><em>viral marketing</em></span> to describe
      network-assisted word of mouth.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch17fn01" id="ch17fn01">61</a>]</sup> The firm had seen the power of virality firsthand with
      Hotmail, which included a vector for infection in every email—the
      now-famous link at the bottom of a message that invited recipients to
      get their own Hotmail account.</p><p>Decades earlier, Frank Bass, one of the founders of marketing
      science, described how messages propagated out in a
      marketplace.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch17fn02" id="ch17fn02">62</a>]</sup> His 1969 paper, “A New Product Growth Model for Consumer
      Durables,” explained how messages trickle out into a market through word
      of mouth. At first, the spread starts slowly, but as more and more
      people start talking about it, spread accelerates. However, as the
      market becomes saturated with people who’ve heard the message, spread
      slows down again. This model is represented by a characteristic
      <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span>-shape known as the Bass diffusion curve, shown in
      <a class="xref" href="ch17.html#three_certainties_deathcomma_taxescomma" title="Figure 17-1. Three certainties: death, taxes, and market saturation">Figure 17-1</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="three_certainties_deathcomma_taxescomma"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00049"/><img alt="Three certainties: death, taxes, and market saturation" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989316.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 17-1. Three certainties: death, taxes, and market saturation</div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1066"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1544"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2290"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2312"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2332"/>When researchers compared the spread of Hotmail to the
      predictions from Bass’s model, they found an almost perfect fit.</p><p>In the Virality stage, it’s time to focus on user acquisition and
      growth, but keep an eye on your stickiness too.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>There’s a risk that you build virality and word of mouth at
          the expense of engagement. Perhaps you’re bringing in new users who
          are different from your earlier adopters, and as a result they don’t
          engage with the product. Or maybe your unique value proposition is
          getting lost in your marketing efforts, and your new users have
          different expectations from earlier ones.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Be careful that you haven’t moved on from stickiness too soon.
          If you’re investing in adding users, but your churn is high, you may
          not be getting a good enough return on investment. Premature growth
          burns money and time, and will quickly kill your startup.</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect1" title="The Three Ways Things Spread"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="three_ways_things_spread" style="clear: both">The Three Ways Things Spread</h2></div></div></div><p>Virality is simply users sharing your product or service with
        others. There are three kinds of virality:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Inherent</strong></span> virality is
            built into the product, and happens as a function of use.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Artificial</strong></span> virality is
            forced, and often built into a reward system.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Word-of-mouth</strong></span> virality is
            the conversations generated by satisfied users, independent of
            your product or service.</p></li></ul></div><p>All three matter, but should be treated as distinct forms of
        growth and analyzed in terms of the kind of traffic they bring in. For
        example, you may find that artificial virality brings in plenty of
        drive-by traffic, but inherent virality brings in engaged customers
        who actually turn into revenue.</p><div class="sect2" title="Inherent Virality"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="inherent_virality">Inherent Virality</h3></div></div></div><p>Many products have inherent virality. When you use TripIt, you
          share your travel plans with colleagues, which they can view better
          when signed in; when you use Expensify, you forward expense reports
          to others for approval; when you use FreshBooks, your customers view
          their electronic invoices on the site.</p><p>This is the best kind of virality. It feels genuine, and the
          recipient is motivated to start using the product or service. It’s
          like an epidemic. It’s not voluntary. It’s not something that you
          opt into doing or experiencing, it just happens.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Artificial Virality"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="artificial_virality">Artificial Virality</h3></div></div></div><p>While inherent virality is best, artificial virality can be
          bought. Parts of Dropbox are inherently viral—users share files with
          colleagues and friends—but the company isn’t afraid to compensate
          its users. It offers additional storage for tweeting or liking the
          product, and rewards users for helping it to acquire new customers.
          The rapid growth of the service happened because of existing users
          trying to convince friends to sign up so they can grow their free
          online storage capacity.</p><p>Artificial virality comes from incentivizing existing users to
          tell their friends. Done right, it can work well—as Dropbox has
          shown—but it can also be awkward and feel forced if done poorly.
          You’re essentially building self-funded marketing activities into
          the product itself, sometimes at the expense of legitimate
          functionality.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Word-of-Mouth Virality"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="word-of-mouth_virality">Word-of-Mouth Virality</h3></div></div></div><p>Finally, there’s natural word of mouth. Harder to track, it’s
          also extremely effective, because it amounts to an endorsement by a
          trusted advisor. You can see some of this activity by simply
          monitoring blogs and social platforms for mentions of your
          startup—and when you see one it’s a good idea to engage with the
          endorser, find out what made him share your product or service, and
          try to turn that into a repeatable, sustainable part of the viral
          growth strategy.</p><p>You may even want to use tools like Klout or PeerReach to try
          to score the impact that those who are discussing you can have on
          awareness of your product or service, since their rankings act as a
          proxy for a person’s ability to spread a message.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Metrics for the Viral Phase"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="metrics_for_the_viral_phase" style="clear: both">Metrics for the Viral Phase</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1717"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2100"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2280"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2306"/>Measuring your viral growth turns out to be really
        important if you don’t want to pay for customers. The number you’re
        after is your viral coefficient, which venture capitalist David Skok
        sums up nicely as “the number of new customers that each existing
        customer is able to successfully convert.”<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch17fn03" id="ch17fn03">63</a>]</sup></p><p>To calculate your viral coefficient:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>First calculate the invitation rate, which is the number of

        of a customer will, in turn, invite another 25% of a customer (6.25%
        of a customer), and so on. In reality, as David points out, it’s
        unlikely that users will continue to invite their friends as time goes
        by—instead, they’ll invite those friends who they think are relevant
        and then stop inviting, and many of those they invite will have the
        same groups of friends. The invitation roster will get
        saturated.</p><p>There’s another factor to consider here: cycle time. If it takes
        only a day for someone to use the site and invite others, you’ll see
        fast growth. On the other hand, if it takes someone months before she
        invites others, you’ll see much slower growth.</p><p>Cycle time makes a huge difference—so much so, David feels it’s
        more important than viral coefficient. Using sample data from a
        worksheet he <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1417"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1780"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1981"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2284"/>created, David underscores this in one of his examples:
        “After 20 days with a cycle time of two days, you will have 20,470
        users, but if you halved that cycle time to one day, you would have
        over 20 million users!”</p><p>Bass’s equations took many of these factors into consideration
        when he was trying to explain how messages propagate out into a
        marketplace and how customers gradually adopt innovation.</p><p>Ultimately, what we’re after is a viral coefficient above 1,
        because this means the product is self-sustaining. With a viral
        coefficient above 1, every single user is inviting at least another
        user, and that new user invites another user in turn. That way, after
        you have some initial users your product grows by itself. In the
        preceding example, we could do several things to push the viral
        coefficient toward 1:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Focus on increasing the acceptance rate.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Try to extend the lifetime of the customer so he has more
            time to invite people.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Try to shorten the cycle time for invitations to get growth
            faster.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Work on convincing customers to invite more people.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Beyond the Viral Coefficient"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="beyond_the_viral_coefficient" style="clear: both">Beyond the Viral Coefficient</h2></div></div></div><p>Treat the three kinds of viral growth differently. Each of them
        will have different conversion rates, and users who come from each
        kind of growth will have different engagement levels. That’ll tell you
        where to focus your efforts.</p><p>The metrics that matter in the virality phase are about outreach
        and new user adoption. While the most fundamental of these is the
        viral coefficient, you can also measure the volume of invites sent by
        a user, or the time it takes her to invite someone.</p><p>For companies selling to an enterprise market, where
        click-to-invite virality isn’t the norm, there are other metrics that
        might work better. One is the <span class="emphasis"><em>net promoter score</em></span>,
        which simply asks how likely a user is to tell his friends about your
        product and compares the number of strong advocates to those who are
        unwilling to recommend it.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch17fn04" id="ch17fn04">64</a>]</sup> It’s a good proxy for virality, because <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1470"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2201"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2309"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2318"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2330"/>it suggests customers who will act as references, refer
        you business, or be quoted in marketing collateral.</p><p>Virality doesn’t play a key role in every business. Some
        products are just not naturally viral, and hardly any are wildly so.
        Much has been made of getting a viral coefficient above 1—in other
        words, getting every user to invite at least one other user. This
        means, in theory, you can grow forever.</p><p>Unfortunately, a sustained viral coefficient above 1 is a Holy
        Grail for startups.</p><p>That doesn’t mean you should ignore virality; rather, it means
        you need to treat it as a force multiplier that will make your paid
        marketing initiatives more successful. That’s why the Virality stage
        comes before the Revenue and Scale stages: you want to get the biggest
        bang for your marketing buck, and to do so, you need to optimize your
        viral engines first.</p></div><div class="sect1 case_study" title="Timehop Experiments with Content Sharing to Achieve Virality"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_timehop_experiments_with_cont" style="clear: both">Timehop Experiments with Content Sharing to Achieve
        Virality</h2></div></div></div><p>Jonathan Wegener and Benny Wong started Timehop in February 2011
        as a hackathon project. The original product—built in a single day and
        called 4SquareAnd7YearsAgo—aggregated your Foursquare check-ins and
        sent them to you in a daily email from one year ago. It was a fun way
        of looking back at where you had been each day last year. The project
        got a lot of attention, and after a few months of watching organic
        growth, the founders decided to focus on it full-time. They rebranded
        as Timehop and raised $1.1 million in financing from venture and angel
        investors.</p><p>The founders spent most of their time at the beginning focusing
        on engagement. Luckily for them, people were hooked on the product,
        and it showed in the core metrics. “We consistently saw 40–50% open
        rates on our emails, and still do,” says Jonathan. “So we knew we had
        a sticky, engaging product that people cared about.”</p><p>Proving that Timehop was an engaging product was essential, but
        so was proving that engagement led to retention. “People have been on
        Timehop for close to two years without ever getting bored and
        leaving,” says Jonathan. “Originally we tracked open rates,
        unsubscribes, and content density [how many users get emails each day
        because they did something a year ago] religiously, but all of that’s
        in very good shape.” It was time to change their One Metric That
        Matters.</p><p>That engagement and retention gave the founders the confidence
        they needed to tackle the next big challenge: growth. “We saw through
        pixel tracking in emails that 50% of emails were being opened on iOS
        devices,” says Jonathan. “That led us to focus on a mobile app, which
        is also a better tool for encouraging growth through sharing.”</p><p>While people do share Timehop emails, email itself is not truly
        social. People <span class="emphasis"><em>received</em></span> emails, but they didn’t
        share them. Since Timehop wants to build what Jonathan describes as a
        “social network for your past,” the move to mobile helps to encourage
        social behaviors. In fact, mobile users share 20 times more than
        email-only users. But it still wasn’t enough.</p><p>“All of our focus right now is on sharing,” says Jonathan. “The
        metric we’re watching is percent of daily active users that share
        something. We don’t focus on the viral coefficient right now—we know
        it’s below 1—and we want to track numbers that are closer to what
        people are doing in our app.” The company is now experimenting and
        testing rapidly to see if it can significantly improve this number. It
        builds fast and focuses on learning and tracking results. And it has a
        line in the sand: “We’d like to have at least 20–30% of our daily
        active users share something on a daily basis,” Jonathan says.</p><p>Timehop cares only about growth through virality (and using
        sharing of content as the primary mechanism for encouraging that
        virality). “All that matters now is virality,” says Jonathan.
        “Everything else—be it press, publicity stunts, or something else—is
        like pushing a rock up a mountain: it will never scale. But being
        viral will.”</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Timehop’s founders turned a one-day hackathon project into a

              said a user would become “engaged” later if he reached seven
              friends within 10 days of creating an account. Josh Elman, who
              worked at Twitter, said the company had a similar metric: when a
              new user follows a minimum number of people—and some of those
              follow back—the user is likely to become engaged. In fact,
              Twitter has two kinds of users: “active” ones who’ve visited at
              least once in the last month, and “core” ones who’ve visited
              seven times in the last month.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Onetime Zynga GM Nabeel Hyatt, who ran a 40-million-player
              game, said the company looked at first-day retention: if someone
              came back the day after she signed up for a game, she was likely
              to become an engaged user (and even one who paid for in-game
              purchases). Hyatt also underscored the importance of identifying
              One Metric That Matters, then optimizing it before moving on to
              the next one.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Dropbox’s ChenLi Wang said the chances that someone

          hack other critical goals like revenue. Josh Elman told us that
          early on Twitter focused its energy on increasing feed views because
          it knew its revenue would be tied to advertising—and that
          advertising could happen only when a user looked at her Twitter
          feed. Number of feed views was a leading indicator of revenue
          potential even before the company hit the Revenue stage.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="What Makes a Good Leading Indicator?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="what_makes_a_good_leading_indicatorquest">What Makes a Good Leading Indicator?</h3></div></div></div><p>Good leading indicators have a few common
          characteristics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1013"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1132"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1258"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1273"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1341"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1527"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1640"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1743"/>Leading indicators tend to relate to social
              engagement (links to friends), content creation (posts, shares,
              likes), or return frequency (days since last visit, time on
              site, pages per visit).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The leading indicator should be clearly tied to a part of
              the business model (such as users, daily traffic, viral spread,
              or revenue). After all, it’s the business model that you’re
              trying to improve. You’re not just trying to increase number of
              friends per user—you’re trying to increase the number of loyal
              users.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The indicator should come early in the
              <span class="emphasis"><em>user’s</em></span> lifecycle or conversion funnel. This
              is a simple numbers game: if you look at something that happens
              on a user’s first day, you’ll have data points for every user,
              butif you wait for users to visit several times, you’ll have
              fewer data points (since many of those users will have churned
              out already), which means the indicator will be less
              accurate.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It should also be an early extrapolation so you get a
              prediction sooner. Recall from <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Model One: E-commerce">Chapter 8</a> that Kevin Hillstrom says the
              best way to understand whether an e-commerce company is a
              “loyalty” or an “acquisition”-focused organization is to look at
              how many second purchases happen in the first 90 days. Rather
              than wait a year to understand what mode you’re in, look at the
              first three months and extrapolate.</p></li></ul></div><p>You find leading indicators by segmentation and cohort
          analysis. Looking at one group of users who stuck around and another
          group who didn’t, you might see something they all have in
          common.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Correlation Predicts Tomorrow"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="correlation_predicts_tomorrow">Correlation Predicts Tomorrow</h3></div></div></div><p>If you’ve found a leading indicator that’s correlated with

          promotion to maximize total purchases. A week before the holiday, it
          sent all its customers a 10% discount code. Those customers who
          purchased something with the code were then sent a second,
          personalized code for 20% off. If they used that code, they were
          sent a final, one-time-only, time-limited code for Cyber Monday that
          gave them 50% off their purchase. This approach increased purchase
          frequency, and encouraged customers to max out their shopping cart
          each time.</p><p>While we don’t have data on the effectiveness of the campaign
