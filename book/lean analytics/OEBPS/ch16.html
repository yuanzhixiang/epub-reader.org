      build something. The big question now is whether or not what you’ve
      built is sticky, so that when you throw users at it, they’ll engage. You
      want to be, as Rowan Atkinson’s <span class="emphasis"><em>Blackadder</em></span> put it,
      “in the stickiest situation since Sticky the stick insect got stuck on a
      sticky bun.” That’s how you make the business sustainable.</p><div class="sect1" title="MVP Stickiness"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="mvp_stickiness" style="clear: both">MVP Stickiness</h2></div></div></div><p>The focus now is squarely on retention and engagement. You can
        look at daily, weekly, and/or monthly active users; how long it takes
        someone to become inactive; how many inactive users can be reactivated
        when sent an email; and which features engaged users spend time with,
        and which they ignore. Segment these metrics by cohort to see if your
        changes convince additional users to behave differently. Did users who
        signed up in February stick around longer than those who joined in
        January?</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1770"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2149"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2222"/>You don’t just want signs of engagement. You want
        <span class="emphasis"><em>proof</em></span> that your product is becoming an integral
        part of your users’ lives, and that it’ll be hard for them to switch.
        You’re not looking for, nor should you expect, rapid growth. You’re
        throwing things at the wall to test stickiness, not measuring how fast
        you can throw. And by “things,” we mean users. After all, if you can’t
        convince a hundred users to stick around today, you’re unlikely to
        convince a million to do so later.<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.ch16fn01" id="ch16fn01">57</a>]</sup></p><p>Your top priority is to build a core set of features that gets
        used regularly and successfully, even by a small group of initial
        users. Without that, you don’t have a solid enough foundation for
        growth. Your initial target market can be very small, hyper-focused on
        the smallest subset of users that you think will generate meaningful
        results.</p><p>Ultimately, you need to prove two things before you can move on
        to the Virality stage:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Are people using the product as you expected? If they
            aren’t, maybe you should switch to that new use case or market, as
            PayPal did when it changed from PalmPilot to web-based payment or
            when Autodesk stopped making desktop automation and instead
            focused on design tools.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Are people getting enough value out of it? They may like it,
            but if they won’t pay, click ads, or invite their friends, you may
            not have a business.</p></li></ul></div><p>Don’t drive new traffic until you know you can turn that extra
        attention into engagement. When you know users keep coming back, it’s
        time to grow your user base.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Iterating the MVP"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="iterating_the_mvp" style="clear: both">Iterating the MVP</h2></div></div></div><p>As we’ve said, the MVP is a process, not a product. You don’t
        pass Go just because you put something into people’s hands. Expect to
        go through many iterations of your MVP before it’s time to shift your
        focus to customer acquisition.</p><p>Iterating on your MVP is difficult, tedious work. It’s
        methodical. Sometimes it doesn’t feel like innovation. Iterations are
        evolutionary; pivots are revolutionary. This is one of the reasons
        founders get frustrated and decide <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1937"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2154"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2179"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2344"/>instead to pivot repeatedly in the hopes that something
        will accidentally engage their users. Resist that temptation.</p><p>As you iterate, your goal is to improve on the core metrics that
        you’re tracking. If a new feature doesn’t significantly improve the
        One Metric That Matters, remove it. Don’t get caught tinkering and
        polishing. You’re not fine-tuning at this point; you’re searching for
        the right product and market.</p></div><div class="sect1 case_study" title="qidiq Changes How It Adds Users"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_qidiq_changes_how_it_adds_use" style="clear: both">qidiq Changes How It Adds Users</h2></div></div></div><p>Qidiq is a tool—for doing really simple surveys of small groups
        via email or a mobile application—that was launched through startup
        accelerator Year One Labs. In early versions of the product, a survey
        creator invited respondents to join a group. Once those respondents
        had signed up and created an account, they could answer surveys
        delivered by email or pushed to an iPhone client.</p><p>Only a small percentage of people who were invited actually
        created an account and responded. So the founders devised a test: why
        not act as if the recipient already had an account, send her a survey
        question she can respond to with a single click or tap, and see what
        the response rate is like? The act of responding could be treated as
        tacit acceptance of enrollment; later, if the recipient wanted to log
        into her account, she could do so through a password recovery.</p><p>The qidiq team quickly changed their application, as illustrated
        in <a class="xref" href="ch16.html#donapostrophet_let_details_like_account" title="Figure 16-1. Don’t let details like account creation get in the way of your core functionality">Figure 16-1</a>, and
        sent out more surveys to personal groups they’d created. These initial
        surveys were sent via email alone. The results were striking: response
        rates went from 10–25% with the enroll-first model to 70–90% with the
        vote-first model. This made the team rethink their plans to develop a
        mobile application, since mobile applications couldn’t compete with
        the cross-platform ubiquity and immediacy of email. Maybe email was
        good enough, and they shouldn’t build their mobile app any more, or
        port it to Android.</p><div class="figure"><a id="donapostrophet_let_details_like_account"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00043"/><img alt="Don’t let details like account creation get in the way of your core functionality" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989310.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 16-1. Don’t let details like account creation get in the way of

        able to avoid the temptation of wasting our energy on the sexier
        mobile app,” says co-founder Jonathan Abrams. “Because it was the
        response rate that mattered, it became clear early on that email,
        while less sexy, was the better strategy for our startup.”</p><p>The metric qidiq was tracking, which was the basis of its whole
        product, was the number of people who would respond to a question.
        That was the right metric, and when the team found a product change
        that moved it dramatically in the right direction, it made them
        rethink the design of their entire service.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The MVP should include the simplest, least-friction path

            reinvent well-understood concepts like an enrollment process with
            which people are familiar, you should also feel free to ignore
            them for the sake of a test.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Focusing on a single metric—in this case, survey response

        Learned</strong></span></p><p>When you’ve got an MVP, you don’t have a product. You have a
        tool for figuring out what product to build. By asking an unorthodox
        question—in this case, “What if users were already registered?”—the
        qidiq team not only quadrupled response rates, but also avoided a
        costly, distracting development rathole.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Premature Virality"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="premature_virality" style="clear: both">Premature Virality</h2></div></div></div><p>Many startups—particularly in the consumer space—focus on
        virality first. They implement features and tactics to try to increase
        user acquisition as much as possible, before really understanding what
        those users will do. This is common for two reasons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>First, the bar for success in a consumer application is
            always going up. A few years ago, hundreds of thousands of users
            was considered big. Today, 1 million users is the benchmark, but
            it’s quickly going to 10 million. That’s a lot of users. Certain
            categories of product, such as social networks and e-commerce, are
            ossifying, with a few gigantic players competing and leaving
            little room for upstarts.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Second, many consumer applications rely on network effects.
            The more users, the more value created for everyone. Nobody wants
            to use the telephone when they’re the only one with a telephone.
            Location-based applications typically require lots of scale, as do
            most marketplaces and user-generated content businesses, so that
            there are enough transactions and discussions to make things
            interesting. Without a critical mass of users, Facebook is an
            empty shell. Reaching this critical mass quickly is the first step
            in delivering the anticipated value of the product.</p></li></ul></div><p>As a result, founders of consumer startups and multiplayer games
        often argue that they need to focus on virality and user acquisition
        because it will solve all their other problems. But having lots of
        users isn’t traction unless those users are engaged and sticking
        around.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1767"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1985"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2147"/>The results of premature scaling can be disastrous if
        startups invest all of their time and money into user acquisition,
        only to watch those users churn too quickly. By the time they go back
        and try to recover those users, they’re gone. You never get a second
        chance to have a first enrollment.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The Goal Is Retention"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="goal_is_retention" style="clear: both">The Goal Is Retention</h2></div></div></div><p>The more engaged that people are with your product (and
        potentially other users of your product), the more likely they’ll
        stay. By ignoring growth from virality (for now), you can simplify how
        you decide what to build next into your MVP. Ask yourself, “Do we
        believe that the feature we want to build (or the feature we want to
        change) will improve stickiness?” Put the feature aside if the answer
        is “no.” But if the answer is “yes,” figure out how to test that
        belief and start building the feature.</p></div><div class="sect1 pattern" title="Seven Questions to Ask Yourself Before Building a Feature"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="pattern_seven_questions_to_ask_yourself" style="clear: both">Seven Questions to Ask Yourself Before Building a
        Feature</h2></div></div></div><p>You probably have a long list of feature ideas you believe will
        improve retention. You need to further prioritize. Here are seven
        questions you can ask yourself (and your team) before building a new
        feature.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>1. Why Will It Make Things
        Better?</strong></span></p><p>You can’t build a feature without having a reason for building
        it. In the Stickiness stage, your focus is retention. Look at your
        potential feature list and ask yourself, “Why do I think this will
        improve retention?”</p><p>You’ll be tempted to copy what others are doing—say, using
        gamification to drive engagement (and in turn retention)—just because
        it looks like it’s working for the competition. Don’t. Qidiq ignored
        common wisdom around the sign-up process and the creation of a mobile
        app and quadrupled engagement. It’s OK to copy existing patterns, but
        know why you’re doing so.</p><p>Asking “Why will it make it better?” forces you to write out (on
        paper!) a hypothesis. This naturally leads to a good experiment that
        will test that hypothesis. Feature experiments, if they’re tied to a
        specific metric (such as retention) are usually easy: you believe
        feature X will improve retention by Y percent. The second part of that
        statement is as important as the first part; you need to draw that
        line in the sand.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1951"/><span class="strong"><strong>2. Can You Measure the Effect of
        the Feature?</strong></span></p><p>Feature experiments require that you measure the impact of the
        feature. That impact has to be quantifiable. Too often, features get
        added to a product without any quantifiable validation—which is a
        direct path toward scope creep and feature bloat.</p><p>If you’re unable to quantify the impact of a new feature, you
        can’t assess its value, and you won’t really know what to do with the
        feature over time. If this is the case, leave it as is, iterate on it,
        or kill it.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>3. How Long Will the Feature Take to
        Build?</strong></span></p><p>Time is a precious resource you never get back. You have to
        compare the relative development time of each feature on your list. If
        something is going to take months to build, you need good confidence
        that it will have a significant impact. Can you break it into smaller
        parts, or test the inherent risk with a curated MVP or a prototype
        instead?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>4. Will the Feature Overcomplicate
        Things?</strong></span></p><p>Complexity kills products. It’s most obvious in the user
        experience of many web applications: they become so convoluted and
        confusing that users leave for a simpler alternative.</p><p>“And” is the enemy of success. When discussing a feature with
        your team, pay attention to how it’s being described. “The feature
        will allow you to do this, <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> it’d be great if
        it did this other thing, <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> this other thing,
        <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> this other thing too.” Warning bells should
        be going off at this point. If you’re trying to justify a feature by
        saying it satisfies several needs a little bit, know that it’s almost
        always better to satisfy <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> need in an
        absolutely epic, remarkable way.</p><p>One mobile analytics expert for an adult-content site told us
        his rule for new features is simple: “If you can’t do it in three taps
        with one hand, it’s broken.” Knowing your user’s behavior and
        expectations is everything. Having feature complexity get in the way
        of the real testing you need to do around your market, customer
        acquisition, and retention is extremely painful.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>5. How Much Risk Is There in This New
        Feature?</strong></span></p><p>Building new features always comes with some amount of risk.
        There’s technical risk related to how a feature may impact the code
        base. There’s user risk in terms of how people might respond to the
        feature. There’s also risk in terms of how a new feature drives future
        development, potentially setting you on a path you don’t want to
        pursue.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2160"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2261"/>Each feature you add creates an emotional commitment for
        your development team, and sometimes for your customers. Analytics
        helps break that bond so that you can measure things honestly and make
        the best decisions possible, with the most information
        available.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>6. How Innovative Is the New
        Feature?</strong></span></p><p>Not everything you do will be innovative. Most features aren’t
        innovative, they’re small tweaks to a product in the hope that the
        whole is more valuable than the individual parts.</p><p>But consider innovation when prioritizing feature development;
        generally, the easiest things to do rarely have a big impact. You’re
        still in the Stickiness stage, trying to find the right product.
        Changing a submit button from red to blue may result in a good jump in
        signup conversions (a classic A/B test), but it’s probably not going
        to turn your business from a failure into a giant success; it’s also
        easy for others to copy.</p><p>It’s better to make big bets, swing for the fences, try more
        radical experiments, and build more disruptive things, particularly
        since you have fewer user expectations to contend with than you will
        later on.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>7. What Do Users
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Say</em></span> They Want?</strong></span></p><p>Your users are important. Their feedback is important. But
        relying on what they say is risky. Be careful about over-prioritizing
        based on user input alone. Users lie, and they don’t like hurting your
        feelings.</p><p>Prioritizing feature development during an MVP isn’t an exact
        science. User actions speak louder than words. Aim for a genuinely
        testable hypothesis for every feature you build, and you’ll have a
        much better chance of quickly validating success or failure. Simply
        tracking how popular various features are within the application will
        reveal what’s working and what’s not. Looking at what feature a user
        was using before he hit “undo” or the back button will pinpoint
        possible problem areas.</p><p>Building features is easy if you plan them beforehand and truly
        understand why you’re doing something. It’s important to tie your
        high-level vision and long-term goals down to the feature level.
        Without that alignment, you run the risk of building features that
        can’t be properly tested and don’t drive the business forward.</p></div><div class="sect1 case_study" title="How Rally Builds New Features with a Lean Approach"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_how_rally_builds_new_features" style="clear: both">How Rally Builds New Features with a Lean Approach</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1068"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1240"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1788"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1848"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1956"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2133"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2155"/>Rally Software makes Agile application lifecycle
        management software. The company was founded in 2002 and has pioneered
        a number of Agile best practices. We spoke with Chief Technologist
        Zach Nies about how the company continues to successfully build its
        products.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Establishing a Company
        Vision</strong></span></p><p>Everything at Rally starts with a three- to five-year company
        vision that is refreshed every 18 months. The entire company aligns
        around the vision, which is the first waypoint in turning a big,
        distant goal into something more attainable. This longer-term vision
        becomes a key input into annual planning each year. Zach says, “When
        we were younger and smaller we didn’t bother looking three years into
        the future, but it’s an important part of the process for a company of
        our size.”</p><p>Annual planning is initially done by a small group of
        executives. Zach calls this the first iteration. The output of the
        initial planning is a draft corporate strategy, which provides a
        clear, concise picture of Rally’s performance gaps and targets,
        reflections, and rationale for the year. The executive team also
        identifies three or four high-level places where they believe the
        company needs to focus action to accomplish the annual vision. “This
        work creates a draft of ideas to bring back to Rally for reflection,”
        Zach says. “They provide a summary of what the executive group saw as
        critically valuable to address in our upcoming year.”</p><p>The second iteration of annual planning takes the form of
        departmental annual retrospectives. Rally uses an approach called ORID
        (Objective, Reflective, Interpretive, Decisional) from <span class="emphasis"><em>The
        Art of Focused Conversation</em></span> by R. Brian Stanfield (New
        Society Publishers).<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch16fn02" id="ch16fn02">58</a>]</sup> Zach says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>This process invites insights from all employees, and provides
          a valuable narrative about the past, present, and future. From each
          ORID within each department, we learn about completed work, the
          current work in progress, planned work, specific annual metrics, the
          implications for the coming year, and the overall mood for the year.
          Kids are learning machines, but adults need structured reflection to
          learn; this process provides that structure.</p></blockquote></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1931"/>Both the executive planning and the ORIDs feed into the
        next step of the annual planning process: gathering 60 people from the
        company in a highly-facilitated meeting to clearly articulate the
        vision for the year and align around how to accomplish it.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Developing a Product
        Plan</strong></span></p><p>The product team is actively involved in defining the company’s
        annual strategy. A big part of this is aligning the directions of the
        company and product. The product team focuses on answering the
        question “Why?” above everything else. “The articulation of why we’re
        doing something, and always questioning our focus, rallies everyone
        around one compelling vision, company, and product, and creates a
        vital emotional connection with our customers,” Zach says. “Only once
        we understand ‘why’ can we really look at ‘what’ and ‘how’.”</p><p>Now Rally is ready to dig into product. While this process may
        seem like a lot, it’s very iterative and Lean. The company goes
        through a

        cycle at several levels before getting to the point where it’s
        actually developing features.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Deciding What to Build</strong></span></p><p>Feature development begins in earnest with deciding what to
        build and how to build it. Rally has an open, but process-oriented,
        way of making feature decisions. Each quarter, employees submit short
        proposals for changes to the company’s product direction. These
        proposals come from anyone in the organization, but are typically
        highly influenced by interactions with customers.</p><p>Zach says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We include almost everyone who does product-management-type
          work in the decision-making process, including product marketing,
          product owners, engineering managers, sales leadership, and
          executives. It may seem like this is quite a bit of process, but the
          benefits of everyone’s input and alignment far outweigh the 10 or so
          hours a quarter we spend running the process. We find strong
          alignment enables great execution.</p></blockquote></div><p>Rally doesn’t release software, but instead “turns features on
        for users and customers.” Most features have a toggle that allows
        Rally to turn them on or off for specific customers. This allows the
        company to roll out code to progressively larger groups of users,
        generating feedback <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1437"/>from early adopters while mitigating the risk of
        exposing problems to a lot of customers.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Measuring Progress</strong></span></p><p>Underneath Rally’s feature development process, the company is
        focused on measurement. “We have an internal data warehouse in which
        we record everything from server/database kernel-level performance
        measurements to high-level user gestures derived from HTTP
        interactions between the browser and our servers,” says Zach. The goal
        is to make sure the team can measure feature usage and performance.
        “When we develop a feature our product team can form theories about
        how much usage warrants further development of that feature,” Zach
        says. “As we are toggling on the feature we can compare our theories
        to actual data. Because the data includes both usage and performance
        information, we can quickly understand, in real time, the impact a
        feature is having on the performance and stability of our production
        environment.”</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Learning Through
        Experiments</strong></span></p><p>Even with such a deep level of planning and an all-inclusive
        approach to product development, Zach still says that the company is
        careful not to “blindly build features based on internal or customer
        requests.” Instead, it runs experiments to learn more.</p><p>According to Zach, every experiment starts with a series of
        questions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>What do we want to learn and why?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What’s the underlying problem we are trying to solve, and
            who is feeling the pain? This helps everyone involved have empathy
            for what we are doing.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What’s our hypothesis? This is written in the form:
            “[Specific repeatable action] will create [expected result].” We
            make sure the hypothesis is written in such a way that the
            experiment is capable of invalidating it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>How will we run the experiment, and what will we build to
            support it?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Is the experiment safe to run?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>How will we conclude the experiment, and what steps will be
            taken to mitigate issues that result from the experiment’s
            conclusion?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2161"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2260"/>What measures will we use to invalidate our
            hypothesis with data? We also include what measures will indicate
            the experiment isn’t safe to continue.</p></li></ul></div><p>In a three-month period, over 20 experiments were run to learn
        exactly what would satisfy users in a critical part of the user
        interface. Rather than guessing, this was a disciplined process of
        discovery. This area of the user interface was a focus because
        refining it was a major part of the product vision for the year, and
        directly supported one of Rally’s corporate goals for the year.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Data-driven product direction starts at the top, and it’s an
            iterative, methodical process.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Everything is an experiment, even when you have an
            established product and a loyal set of customers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It takes extra engineering effort to be able to turn on and
            off individual features, and to measure the resulting change in
            user behavior, but that investment pays off in reduced cycle time
            and better learning.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Analytics Lessons
        Learned</strong></span></p><p>Rally has taken measurement to the next level. In a way, Rally
        is two companies—one making lifecycle management software, and one
        running a gigantic, continuous experiment on its users to better
        understand how they interact with the product itself. This requires a
        lot of discipline and focus, as well as considerable engineering
        effort to make every feature testable and measurable, but it’s paid
        off in less waste, a better product, and a consistent alignment with
        what customers want.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="How to Handle User Feedback"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="how_to_handle_user_feedback" style="clear: both">How to Handle User Feedback</h2></div></div></div><p>Customers have something in common with entrepreneurs—they’re
        liars too. They don’t lie intentionally, but often they forget how
        your product really works or what they were doing in the
        product.</p><p>Many of the reviews for personal banking app Mint give the
        product one star, saying, “Warning! This product will try to collect
        your banking information and connect to your bank account!” as shown
        in <a class="xref" href="ch16.html#warningem_dashbanking_app_may_want_your" title="Figure 16-2. Warning—banking app may want your banking details">Figure 16-2</a>.

        ignore this feedback, but what it’s really telling you is that your
        marketing and product descriptions aren’t working, bringing down your
        product ratings and reducing your addressable market.</p><p>Customers may give you feedback you don’t like. Just remember
        that they don’t have the same mental model you do, they aren’t in your
        target market. They often lack training to use your product
        properly.</p><p>We’ve already seen some of the cognitive biases demonstrated by
        interview subjects. Existing users suffer from similar biases. They
        have different expectations and context from you. You need to view
        their feedback with that in mind.</p><p>For one thing, user feedback suffers from horrible sampling
        bias. Few people provide feedback when they have a predictable, tepid
        experience. They reach out when they’re ecstatic or furious. If
        they’re feeling aggrieved, you’ll hear from them.</p><p>What’s more, they don’t know their value to you. They may feel
        entitled to a free product because that’s how you’ve positioned your
        SaaS offering, or to free breadsticks because that’s how you’ve priced
        your buffet. You know their value to your business—they don’t. To each
        unhappy user he or she is, they’re the most important person in the
        world. And he or she has been wronged or celebrated.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1584"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2263"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2264"/>Finally, customers aren’t aware of the constraints and
        nuances of their problems. It’s easy to complain about US television
        programming not being available overseas; it’s unlikely that those
        complaining are aware of the intricacies of foreign currency exchange,
        censorship, and copyright licensing. They want their problem solved,
        but they have little insight into how to solve it the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>right</em></span> way.</p><p>Laura Klein is a user experience (UX) professional and
        consultant, as well as the author of <span class="emphasis"><em>UX for Lean
        Startups</em></span> (forthcoming from O’Reilly), part of the Lean
        Series along with this book. She writes a great blog called Users
        Know. You should read her post, “Why Your Customer Feedback is
        Useless,” in its entirety.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch16fn03" id="ch16fn03">59</a>]</sup></p><p>To improve how you interpret feedback, Laura has three
        suggestions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Plan tests ahead of time, and know what you want to learn
            before you get started. “A big reason that feedback is hard to
            interpret is because there’s just too much of it, and it’s not
            well organized or about a particular topic,” says Laura. “If you
            know exactly what you’re gathering feedback on, and you’re
            disciplined about the methods you use to gather it, it becomes
            very simple to interpret the responses.”</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Don’t talk to just anybody. “You should group feedback from
            similar personas,” says Laura. “For example, if I ask a Formula 1
            driver and my mom about how they feel about their cars, I’m going
            to get inconsistent responses.” Balancing feedback like that is
            very difficult because it’s from such different types of people.
            “Figure out who your customers are and focus your research on a
            particular type of person.”</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Review results quickly as you collect data. “Don’t leave it
            all until the end,” Laura notes. “If you talk to five people for
            an hour each over the course of a few days, it can be really hard
            to remember what the first person said.” Laura recommends having
            someone else in each session, so that you can debrief with that
            person after and pull out the top takeaways from the
            session.</p></li></ul></div><p>The reality is, users will always complain. That’s just the way
        it goes. Even if people are using your product, you have good
        engagement metrics, and your product is sticky, they’re still going to
        complain. Listen to their complaints, and try to get to the root of
        the issue as quickly as possible without overreacting.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The Minimum Viable Vision"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="minimum_viable_vision" style="clear: both">The Minimum Viable Vision</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1497"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1641"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1723"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2077"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2150"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2254"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2341"/>The <span class="emphasis"><em>minimum viable vision</em></span> is a term
        coined by entrepreneur and Year One Labs partner Raymond Luk. He says,
        “If you’re trying to build a great company and get others involved,
        it’s not enough to find an MVP—you need an MVV, too.”</p><p>A minimum viable vision (MVV) is one that captivates. It scales.
        It has potential. It’s audacious and compelling. As a founder, you
        have to hold that huge, hairy, world-changing vision in one hand, and
        the practical, pragmatic, seat-of-the-pants reality in the other. The
        MVV you need in order to get funding demands a convincing explanation
        of how you can become a dominant, disruptive player in your
        market.</p><p>Here are some signs that suggest you’ve got the makings of an
        MVV:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p title="You’re building a platform."><span class="title"><strong><span class="bolditalic">You’re building a
              platform.</span></strong></span> If you’re creating an environment in which other things
              can be created, this is a good sign. Google Maps was just one of
              the many mapping tools available, alongside MapQuest and others,
              but Google made it easy to embed and annotate those maps,
              leading to thousands of mashups and clever uses. It quickly
              became the de facto platform for entry-level geographic
              information systems (GIS), and all those annotations made its
              maps even more useful.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="You have recurring ways to make money."><span class="title"><strong><span class="bolditalic">You have recurring ways to
              make money.</span></strong></span> It’s one thing to take money from someone once, but if you
              can convince that person to pay every month as well, you’re onto
              something. Just look at Blizzard’s revenues from <span class="emphasis"><em>World
              of Warcraft</em></span>: purchase of the paid desktop client is a
              fraction of the money the company makes compared to revenue from

              companies like 37Signals, Wufoo, and FreshBooks have done, then
              you can hook your users on basic features and tempt them with an
              upgrade path that adds functionality as they need it. This means
              you’ll not only add revenue from new users, but from existing
              ones, too.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="You’re tied to a disruptive change."><span class="title"><strong><span class="bolditalic">You’re tied to a disruptive

              better chance of growth. A rising tide floats all boats, and a
              rising tech sector floats all valuations and exits.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Adopters automatically become advocates."><span class="title"><strong><span class="bolditalic">Adopters automatically become

              invited the recipient to switch to Hotmail. The result
              <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1783"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2245"/>was an exponential growth rate and a huge exit for
              the founders.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch16fn04" id="ch16fn04">60</a>]</sup> An expense management system like Expensify makes
              it as easy as possible to add others to the approval workflow,
              because this is a vector for inherent virality.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="You can create a bidding war."><span class="title"><strong><span class="bolditalic">You can create a bidding
              war.</span></strong></span> If you’ve got a solution that several industry giants will
              want, you’re in a great place. While big companies can build
              anything given enough time, they’ll buy you if you’re stealing
              their sales or if your product helps them sell dramatically more
              easily. Beverage giants like Pepsico, Cadbury-Schweppes, and
              Coca-Cola regularly buy out promising incumbents, like Odwalla,
              Tropicana, Minute Maid, RC Cola, and others, knowing they can
              make back their investment easily through their existing supply

              marketing, environmental forces include everything you’re
              subject to in your business ecosystem, such as
              government-mandated privacy laws or anti-pollution regulations.
              If you’re building something that everyone will be forced to
              adopt (such as a product that complies with soon-to-be-signed
              health or payment privacy legislation), you’ve got a promising
              exit and a chance to take over the sector.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="You’ve got a sustainable unfair advantage."><span class="title"><strong><span class="bolditalic">You’ve got a sustainable
              unfair advantage.</span></strong></span> There’s nothing investors like more than unfairness. If
              you can maintain an unfair advantage—lower costs, better market
              attention, partners, proprietary formulae, and so on—then you
              can scale your business to a degree where it’s interesting to
              investors. But be careful: outside of government-mandated
              monopolies, few advantages are truly sustainable in the long
              term.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="Your marginal costs trend to zero."><span class="title"><strong><span class="bolditalic">Your marginal costs trend to
              zero.</span></strong></span> If as you add users your incremental costs go down—so that
              the <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>th customer costs almost nothing to
              add—that’s a great place to be. You’re enjoying healthy
              economies of scale. For example, an antivirus company has fixed
              costs of software development and research that must be
              amortized across all customers, but the addition of one more
              client adds only a vanishingly small cost to this total.
              Businesses that can grow revenues while incremental costs stay
              still or decline have the potential to grow massively
              overnight.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="There are inherent network effects in the model."><span class="title"><strong><span class="bolditalic">There are inherent network

              a network effect: the more people who use it, the more useful it
              becomes. Network-effect businesses are wonderful, but they often
              have a two-edged sword: it’s great when you <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1284"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1293"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1610"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1663"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1746"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1880"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1892"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1924"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2037"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2153"/>have 10 million users, but you may be deluding
              yourself about how easily users will adopt the product or
              service, and it’s hard to test the basic value with a small
              market at first. You need a plan for getting to the point where
              the network effects kick in and become obvious.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="You have several ways to monetize."><span class="title"><strong><span class="bolditalic">You have several ways to
              monetize.</span></strong></span> It’s unlikely that any one payment model will work, but if
              you can find several ways to make money from a business—one
              obvious one, and several incidental ones—then you can diversify
              your revenue streams and iterate more easily, improving your
              chances of success. Quick note: AdWords and selling your
              analytical data probably aren’t enough.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="You make money when your customers make money."><span class="title"><strong><span class="bolditalic">You make money when your
              customers make money.</span></strong></span> Humans are, at their most basic, motivated by two things:
              fear and greed. While that might seem a bit cynical, it’s how we
              evolved. In business, fear means things like costs and risks,
              and if you reduce risks or cut costs, that’s nice—but it’s not
              compelling. Customers will often rationalize away the risk and
              pocket the savings. But if you make money from greed (or, as
              it’s known in the business world, revenues) then the customer
              will likely split the winnings with you. Products that boost
              revenues are easier for people to believe in—just look at
              lotteries and get-rich-quick schemes versus savings plans and
              life insurance. Eventbrite and Kickstarter know this.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p title="An ecosystem will form around you."><span class="title"><strong><span class="bolditalic">An ecosystem will form around
              you.</span></strong></span> This is similar to the platform model. Salesforce and
              Photoshop are good examples of this: Salesforce’s App Exchange
              has thousands of third-party applications that make the CRM
              (customer relationship management) provider more useful and
              customizable, and Photoshop’s plug-in model added features to
              the application far more quickly than if Adobe had coded them
              all itself.</p></li></ul></div><p>In the end, you have to be audacious. You need to understand how
        your company can become a Big Idea, something that’s truly new, and
        either widely appealing to a broad market or a must-have for a
        well-heeled niche.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The Problem-Solution Canvas"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="problem-solution_canvas" style="clear: both">The Problem-Solution Canvas</h2></div></div></div><p>At Year One Labs, we developed a tool called the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Problem-Solution Canvas</em></span> to help our startups
        maintain discipline and focus on a weekly basis. It’s inspired by Ash
        Maurya’s Lean Canvas, but focused on the day-to-day operations of a
        startup. We used it to home in on the key one to three problems the
        startups were facing. It allowed us all to agree on those problems and

        job—where we could provide significant value because of our
        detachment—was to guide entrepreneurs back to what was most
        important.</p><p>The Problem-Solution Canvas is a two-page document. Like a Lean
        Canvas it’s divided into a few boxes. On a weekly basis we’d ask
        founders to prepare a Problem-Solution Canvas and present it. The
        canvas became the focal point for our status meetings, and it was
        extremely helpful for keeping those meetings productive.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch16.html#if_you_filled_in_this_page_every_weekcom" title="Figure 16-3. If you filled in this page every week, what would you learn?">Figure 16-3</a>
        shows the first page of the template.</p><div class="figure"><a id="if_you_filled_in_this_page_every_weekcom"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00045"/><img alt="If you filled in this page every week, what would you learn?" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989312.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 16-3. If you filled in this page every week, what would you
          learn?</div></div><p>The first thing you’ll notice is the title: <span class="emphasis"><em>The Goal
        Is to Learn</em></span>. This is important, because it reminded the
        entrepreneurs about what they were setting out to do. It wasn’t about
        building “stuff.” It wasn’t about adding features. It wasn’t about
        getting PR, or anything else. Learning was the measure of
        success.</p><p>Next, founders would fill in a brief update on their current
        status, focusing on the key metrics (qualitative and/or quantitative)
        that they were tracking. Notice how small this box is compared to the
        others.</p><p>The Lessons Learned box is a quick bulleted summary of key
        learning. The title says “and Accomplishments” because we wanted to
        give entrepreneurs a place to brag—at least a little bit. Not
        surprisingly, they’d include some vanity metrics in here and we
        wouldn’t spend a lot of time on them. The “On track: Yes/No” benchmark
        is designed as a test of intellectual honesty. Can entrepreneurs
        really come clean on what’s going on, good and bad? If so, we could be
        much more valuable.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1927"/>Finally, we asked entrepreneurs to list the top problems
        they were facing at that moment. At most they would include three
        problems prioritized in order of importance. This section of the
        Problem-Solution Canvas often elicited the most debate, but it was
        always healthy and critical for resetting everyone’s goals and
        expectations.</p><p>With the problems now well understood, along with the startup’s
        current status, we’d move to the second page of the canvas, shown in
        <a class="xref" href="ch16.html#weapostropheve_all_got_problemsem_dashbu" title="Figure 16-4. We’ve all got problems—but can you pick just three?">Figure 16-4</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="weapostropheve_all_got_problemsem_dashbu"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00046"/><img alt="We’ve all got problems—but can you pick just three?" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989313.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 16-4. We’ve all got problems—but can you pick just three?</div></div><p>In this section, the founders re-list the problems and include
        hypothesized solutions. These solutions are hypothesized because we
        don’t know if they’ll work. These are experiments that the founders
        will run in the next week. We always asked them to define the metrics
        they’d use to measure success (or failure) and draw a line in the
        sand. If engagement was the most important problem, they had to
        include possible solutions they’d experiment with to increase
        engagement, define the metric (e.g., % daily active users), and set a
        target. <span class="emphasis"><em>What’s the problem, how do you propose to fix it,
        and how will you know if you succeeded?</em></span> That’s the core of
        the Problem-Solution Canvas.</p><p>For us (as mentors and advisors), it was an extremely valuable
        exercise. The Problem-Solution Canvas is also useful for internal
        decision making. It sits a level below the Lean Canvas, focusing on
        very specific details in a very specific time period (one to two
        weeks).</p></div><div class="sect1 case_study" title="VNN Uses the Problem-Solution Canvas to Solve Business Problems"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="case_study_vnn_uses_the_problem-solution" style="clear: both">VNN Uses the Problem-Solution Canvas to Solve Business
        Problems</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1928"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2162"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2276"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2277"/>Varsity News Network (VNN) is an early-stage startup
        based in Michigan. Ben met one of the founders there, Ryan Vaughn,
        when speaking at a conference in 2012. The company’s platform makes it
        easy for athletic directors to manage social communication, creating
        hyper-local media coverage about athletics at their high schools. The
        goal is to leverage that awareness creation into ongoing financial and
        emotional support for high school sports.</p><p>Ryan was introduced to the Problem-Solution Canvas and started
        using it immediately with his board of directors. “We had just raised
        financing and had to solve a number of key business problems very
        quickly,” said Ryan. “We used the Problem-Solution Canvas to get all
        our board members on the same page, focused on what we had to do in
        order to move forward.”</p><p>VNN followed a Lean process, particularly in the beginning of
        the company in order to determine its value proposition and how that
        tied into producing content about high school sports. The company
        remains Lean today, testing and iterating each new feature or
        initiative it launches, measuring effectiveness and value
        creation.</p><p>Still, Ryan was concerned that his board wouldn’t embrace the
        Problem-Solution Canvas. He said, “The Lean Startup process has not
        been widely adopted in the Midwest yet, but our board had been exposed
        to the methodology, which helped speed up our initial progress with
        the canvas.”</p><p>VNN used the canvas for a few months, during a critical time of
        problem solving. The result was that everyone involved stayed focused
        on the major tasks at hand. Through the Problem-Solution Canvas, VNN
        validated a number of its core assumptions and designed a scalable
        growth model involving direct sales. This allowed it to prove enough
        of its business to start generating revenue and plan for a second
        round of financing.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch16.html#vnn_spends_some_time_on_introspection" title="Figure 16-5. VNN spends some time on introspection">Figure 16-5</a> and
