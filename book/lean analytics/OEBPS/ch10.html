      mobile app. If you’re selling a mobile application for money, you have a
      fairly straightforward sales funnel—you promote the application, and
      people pay you for it. But when you derive your revenue from other
      sources, such as in-game content, paying for features, or advertising,
      the model gets more complex. If, after looking at the business model
      flipbook in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. What Business Are You In?">Chapter 7</a>,
      you’ve decided you’re running a mobile app business, then this is what
      analytics look like for you.</p><p>The mobile application has emerged as a startup business model
      with the rise of iPhone and Android smartphone ecosystems. Apple’s
      application model is tightly regimented, with the company controlling
      what’s allowed and reviewing submissions. Applications for the Android
      platform may be downloaded from the Android store or “side-loaded” from
      sources that aren’t tightly controlled.</p><p>For Lean startups, an app store model<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.ch10fn01" id="ch10fn01">34</a>]</sup> presents a challenge. Unlike web applications, where it’s
      easy to do A/B testing and continuous deployment, mobile apps go through
      the app store gatekeeper—which limits the number of iterations a company
      can undergo, and hampers experimentation. Modern mobile apps are getting
      around the gatekeepers to some degree <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1025"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1109"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1325"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1429"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1543"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1659"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1725"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1727"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1733"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1747"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1893"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2209"/>by feeding in online content without requiring an actual
      app upgrade, but this takes extra work to set up. Some developers
      advocate trying out the Android platform first because it’s easier to
      push frequent updates to users. Once those developers have validated
      their MVP on Android, they move to Apple’s more constrained deployment
      environment. Others choose a smaller, secondary market (like the
      Canadian App Store) and work the bugs out there first.</p><p>Mobile app developers make money within their applications in
      several ways:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Downloadable content (such as new maps or

      advertising. Users find the application in an app store, either by
      searching or because it’s showcased due to popularity or as part of a
      list. They consider the application—consulting ratings, number of
      downloads, other titles, and written reviews—and ultimately download the
      application. Then they launch it and start playing.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1064"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1078"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1144"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1214"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1597"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1700"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1731"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1873"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1875"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2291"/>The game has an in-game economy (gold coins) that can be
      used to buy weapons or health more quickly than by simply playing the
      game. There’s also a way to watch ads that pays gold coins. The company
      spends considerable time striking a balance between making it enjoyable
      for casual players (who don’t want to pay) while still making a purchase
      attractive (so players pay a small amount). This is where the science of
      economics meets the psychology of game design.</p><p>The company cares about the following key metrics:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Downloads</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>How many people have downloaded the application, as well as

      SaaS business model, but there are some that differ significantly in a
      mobile app world.</p><div class="sect1" title="Installation Volume"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="installation_volume" style="clear: both">Installation Volume</h2></div></div></div><p>According to mobile analytics consultancy and developer Distimo,
        getting featured in an app store has a huge impact on app
        sales.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch10fn02" id="ch10fn02">35</a>]</sup> An app that’s already in the top 100 and then gets
        featured will jump up an average of 42 places on the Android market,
        27 places on the iPad App Store, and 15 places on the iPhone App
        Store.</p><p>For mobile developers, the dynamics of an app store matter more
        than almost anything else when it comes to achieving significant
        traction. Being showcased on the home page of Apple’s App Store
        routinely yields a hundredfold increase in traffic.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch10fn03" id="ch10fn03">36</a>]</sup> Analytics firm Flurry estimates that in 2012, the top 25
        applications in the iPhone App Store accounted for roughly 15% of all
        revenue, and the rest of the top 100 accounted for roughly 17%. Lenny
        Rachitsky, founder of Localmind, a social mobile location app that was
        part of Year One Labs, said, “Getting featured is the single biggest
        thing that ever happened to us. It even matters what slot you’re
        featured in on the App Store, which affects whether you appear above
        the fold or not.”</p><p>Alexandre Pelletier-Normand, co-founder of Execution Labs, a
        game development accelerator, says that getting featured on Google
        Play is even more beneficial for revenue than being featured in
        Apple’s App Store. “Getting featured on Google Play boosts your
        ranking, and the rankings in Google Play are quite static compared to
        the App Store. That means you’ll rank higher for longer, which in turn
        means more revenue.”</p><p>While this unfair advantage is gradually changing—revenues for
        less popular applications are growing overall—the facts are simple: if
        you want to make money, you need to be ranked highly in app stores,
        and getting featured helps a great deal.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Average Revenue Per User"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="average_revenue_per_user" style="clear: both">Average Revenue Per User</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1065"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1079"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1399"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1734"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1749"/>Mobile app developers are constantly finding ingenious
        ways to monetize their applications. These developers focus on the
        average revenue per user (ARPU) on a monthly or lifetime basis. Many
        game developers instrument their applications heavily themselves,
        since there isn’t a dominant, open way to collect data from
        applications easily.</p><p>If you’re making a game, you don’t just care about revenue.
        You’re walking a fine line between the compelling content and
        addictive gameplay that makes things fun and the in-game purchases
        that bring in money. Avoiding the “money grab” that turns players off
        is hard: you need to keep users coming back and inviting their friends
        while still extracting a pound of flesh each month (or at least a few
        dollars!). As a result, in addition to ARPU, some metrics relate to
        playability (ensuring the game is neither too hard nor too easy, and
        that players don’t get stuck) and player engagement.</p><p>ARPU is simply the revenue you’ve made, divided by the number of
        active users or players you have. If you inflate the number of active
        players to make yourself look good, you’ll reduce the ARPU, so this
        metric forces you to draw a realistic line in the sand about what
        “engaged” means. Typically, ARPU is calculated on a monthly
        period.</p><p>For mobile games, you can measure customer lifetime value (CLV)
        by calculating the averages of the money spent by every player
        post-churn. But because it will (hopefully!) take months or years for
        a player to leave you, it’s easier to estimate the CLV in the way we
        did for a SaaS company.</p><p>Let’s return to our example of a free mobile game that makes
        money from in-game purchases and ads. This month, it’s had just over
        12,300 downloads, and 96% of those people launch the app and connect
        to the company’s servers. Of these, 30% become “engaged” players that
        use the application on three separate days.</p><p>Each engaged player generates, on average, $3.20 a month in
        revenue, from a mix of in-game purchases and advertising. This means
        that the current month’s downloads will generate about $11,339 in
        revenue (though it may take time for the company to receive that
        revenue because of the app store’s payment model).</p><p>Of the total players, 15% churn every month, which means the
        average player lifetime is 6.67 months (1/0.15). This in turn means
        that the company’s monthly revenue is around $75,500. The player
        lifetime value is the ARPU multiplied by the player lifetime—in this
        case, $21.33. If the company knows the cost of acquiring an engaged
        player, it can also calculate the amount each player contributes to
        the bottom line, the return on investment in advertising efforts, and
        how long it takes to recover the investment made in acquiring an
        engaged user. <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#how_to_calculate_all_the_essential_metri" title="Figure 10-1. How to calculate all the essential metrics for a mobile app">Figure 10-1</a> shows how all
        these calculations are performed.</p><div class="figure"><a id="how_to_calculate_all_the_essential_metri"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00024"/><img alt="How to calculate all the essential metrics for a mobile app" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989282.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 10-1. How to calculate all the essential metrics for a mobile
          app</div></div><p>The business model for the company hinges on these numbers. The
        company needs to increase download volumes, increase the engagement
        rate, maximize ARPU, minimize churn, and improve virality so customer
        acquisition costs go down. There’s a natural tension between these
        goals—<a class="indexterm" id="iddle1188"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1432"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1573"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1876"/>for example, making the game more enjoyable so people
        don’t churn versus extracting money so ARPU is high—and this is where
        the art and finesse of game design comes in.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Percentage of Users Who Pay"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="percentage_of_users_who_pay" style="clear: both">Percentage of Users Who Pay</h2></div></div></div><p>There are some players who simply won’t spend money in a game.
        And there are others (often referred to as “whales”) who will spend
        literally <span class="emphasis"><em>thousands</em></span> of dollars to gain the upper
        hand in a game they love. Knowing the difference between the two—and
        finding ways to make more users purchase things within the
        application—is the key to a successfully monetized free mobile
        application.</p><p>The most basic metric here is the percentage of users who pay
        something. Beyond this basic metric, you want to do segmentation and
        cohort analysis. If, for example, you know that a particular ad
        campaign brought in users who were more likely to make in-game
        purchases, you should be running more campaigns like that. You also
        need to be sophisticated in terms of what you market to users in-game:
        whales are more likely to make bigger in-app purchases, whereas users
        who haven’t bought anything yet should be offered something
        inexpensive to start.</p><p>Measuring your ARPU gives you a good idea of how much paying
        users are spending. Convincing an already-paying user to pay more may
        not have a significant impact on your ARPU because most users won’t
        pay, but it could absolutely move the needle on revenue in a
        significant way. Treat your <span class="emphasis"><em>paying</em></span> users as a
        separate customer base and track their behavior, churn, and revenue
        separately from your nonpaying ones.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Churn"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="churn-id00002" style="clear: both">Churn</h2></div></div></div><p>We’ve looked at churn in detail in <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Model Two: Software as a Service (SaaS)">Chapter 9</a>. It’s also a
        critical metric for mobile applications. Keith Katz, co-founder of
        Execution Labs, a game development accelerator, and former Vice
        President of Monetization for OpenFeint, recommends looking at churn
        in specific time periods:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Track churn at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month, because users leave

          it could be that your game isn’t “deep enough,” and after a month it
          could be poor update planning.</p></blockquote></div><p>Knowing when users churn gives you an indication of why they’re

The
        company is building a formula for successful social games that’s
        completely driven by numbers. The company has over 32 million active
        monthly users from 231 countries, and over 7 million daily users. In a
        2012 <span class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> article, founder Jens Begemann shared
        his company’s approach.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch10fn04" id="ch10fn04">37</a>]</sup></p><p>Wooga iterates constantly and releases updates on a weekly
        basis. It picks a key metric to focus on for an update—retention, for
        example—and identifies a number of tactics to try to improve it. When
        the update is released, it measures the changes rigorously and adapts
        from there. All told, Jens reviews 128 data points on a daily basis.
        If he sees something that doesn’t make sense to him, he sends that to
        the product teams. It’s up to the product people at that point to home
        in on the number in question and figure out what’s going on, and how
        to make it better.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Wrinkles: In-App Monetization Versus Advertising"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="wrinkles_in-app_monetization_versus_adve" style="clear: both">Wrinkles: In-App Monetization Versus Advertising</h2></div></div></div><p>One of the factors that can complicate this model is the
        monetization approach. As we’ve seen, there are a wide variety of ways
        in which companies monetize their mobile applications. Some
        advertising consists of in-app videos; in other cases, it can be a
        “promoted download” where the user is encouraged to try out another
        app. When this happens, the user leaves the current application—which
        can increase churn, reduce engagement, and hamper the
        experience.</p><p>Game developers have to find ways to carefully integrate
        monetization, particularly when it doesn’t fit the theme of the game,
