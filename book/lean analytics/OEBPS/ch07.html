      care about. In the long term, the riskiest part of a business is often
      directly tied to how it makes money.</p><p>Many startups can build a product and solve technical issues, some
      can attract the right (and occasionally large) audiences, but few make
      money. Even giants like Twitter and Facebook have struggled with
      extracting money from their throngs of users.</p><p>There’s no more iconic symbol of a startup than the lemonade
      stand, and with good reason—it’s a simple, entrepreneurial, low-risk way
      to learn how businesses operate. And like a lemonade stand, while it
      might be reasonable and strategic to delay monetization—giving away
      lemonade for a while to build a clientele—you have to be planning your
      business model early on.</p><p>If we asked you to describe the business model of a lemonade
      stand, you’d probably say that it’s about selling lemonade for more than
      it costs to make it. Pressed for more detail, you might say that costs
      include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Variable costs of materials (lemons, sugar, cups,
          water)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>One-time costs of marketing (stand, signage, cooler, bribing a
          younger sibling to stand in the street)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Hourly costs of staffing (which, let’s face it, are pretty
          negligible when you’re a kid)</p></li></ul></div><p>You might also say that revenue is a function of the price you
      charge, and the number of cups sold.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1506"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1653"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1828"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2010"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2356"/>Now let’s suppose that you’re asked to identify the risky
      parts of the business. They include the variability of citrus futures,
      the weather, the foot traffic in your neighborhood, and so on.</p><p>One thing we’ve noticed about almost all successful founders we’ve
      met is their ability to work at both a very detailed, and a very
      abstracted, level within their business. They can worry about the layout
      of a page or the wording of an email subject one day, and consider the
      impact of one-time versus monthly recurring sales the next. That’s
      partly because they’re not only trying to run a business, they’re also
      trying to discover the best business model.</p><p>To decide which metrics you should track, you need to be able to
      describe your business model in no more complex a manner than a lemonade
      stand’s. You need to step back, ignore all the details, and just think
      about the really big components.</p><p>When you reduce things to their basic building blocks in this way,
      you come up with only a few fundamental business models on the Web.
      Interestingly, all of them share some common themes. First, their aim is
      to grow (in fact, Paul Graham says that a focus on growth is the one
      defining attribute of a startup).<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch07fn01" id="ch07fn01">21</a>]</sup> And second, that growth is achieved by one of Eric Ries’s
      fundamental Engines of Growth: an increase in stickiness, virality, or
      revenue.</p><p>Each business model needs to maximize the thrust from these three
      engines in order to flourish. Sergio Zyman, Coca-Cola’s CMO, said
      marketing is about <span class="emphasis"><em>selling more stuff to more people more
      often for more money more efficiently</em></span>.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch07fn02" id="ch07fn02">22</a>]</sup></p><p>Business growth comes from improving one of these five
      “knobs”:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>More stuff</strong></span> means adding
          products or services, preferably those you know your customers want
          so you don’t waste time building things they won’t use or buy. For
          intrapreneurs, this means applying Lean methods to new product
          development, rather than starting an entirely new company.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>More people</strong></span> means adding
          users, ideally through virality or word of mouth, but also through
          paid advertising. The best way to add users is when it’s an integral
          part of product use—such as Dropbox, Skype, or a project management
          tool that invites outside users outsiders—<a class="indexterm" id="iddle2265"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2345"/>since this happens automatically and implies an
          endorsement from the inviting user.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>More often</strong></span> means stickiness
          (so people come back), reduced churn (so they don’t leave), and
          repeated use (so they use it more frequently). Early on, stickiness
          tends to be a key knob on which to focus, because until your core
          early adopters find your product superb, it’s unlikely you can
          achieve good viral marketing.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>More money</strong></span> means upselling
          and maximizing the price users will pay, or the revenue from ad
          clicks, or the amount of content they create, or the number of
          in-game purchases they make.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>More efficiently</strong></span> means
          reducing the cost of delivering and supporting your service, but
          also lowering the cost of customer acquisition by doing less paid
          advertising and more word of mouth.</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect1" title="About Those People"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="about_those_people" style="clear: both">About Those People</h2></div></div></div><p>Business models are about getting people to do what you want in
        return for something. <span class="emphasis"><em>But not all people are
        equal</em></span>. The plain truth is that not every user is good for
        you.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Some are good—but only in the long term. Evernote’s freemium
            model works partly because users eventually sign up for paying
            accounts, but it can take them two years to do so.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Some provide, at best, free marketing, and while they may
            never become paying users, they may amplify your message or invite
            someone who will pay.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Some are downright bad—they distract you, consume resources,
            spam your site, or muddy your analytics.</p></li></ul></div><p>When you get a wave of visibility, few of the resulting visitors
        will actually engage with your product. Many are just driving by. As
        Vinicius Vacanti, co-founder and CEO of Yipit, recalls in a blog post
        inspired by his company’s 2010 launch:<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch07fn03" id="ch07fn03">23</a>]</sup></p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Was that our big launch? Why didn’t more people sign up? Why
          didn’t people complete the sign-up flow? Why weren’t people coming
          back? Now that people covered our startup, how are we supposed to
          get more press? Why aren’t our users pushing their actions to
          Facebook and Twitter? We got some users to invite their friends but
          why aren’t their friends accepting the invite?</p></blockquote></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1463"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2096"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2336"/>The key here is analytics. You need to segment real,
        valuable users from drive-by, curious, or detrimental ones. Then you
        need to make changes that maximize the real users and weed out the bad
        ones. That may be as blunt as demanding a credit card up front—a sure
        way to reject curious users who don’t have any intention of committing
        or paying. Or it may be a subtler approach, such as not trying to
        reactivate disengaged users once they’ve been gone for a while.</p><p>If you’re a developer of a game that users play once, or an
        e-commerce site stocking rarely purchased items, that’s fine—just get
        your money up front. If you’re a SaaS provider with low incremental
        costs for additional users, freemium may work, as long as you clearly
        separate engaged from casual users. If you expect buyers to purchase
        from you often, you need to make them feel loved. You get the
        picture.</p><p>Segmenting real users from casual ones also depends on how much
        effort your users have to put into using the application. Some
        products collect information passively: Fitbit logs walking steps;
        Siri notices when you’ve arrived somewhere; Writethatname analyzes
        your inbox for new contacts. Users don’t have to do much, so it can be
        hard to tell if they’ve “checked out.” It’s easier to find disengaged
        users if they have to actively use the product.</p><p>Consider the aforementioned Fitbit, a tiny life-logging device
        that measures steps, from which it calculates calories burned, miles
        walked, stairs climbed, and overall activity.</p><p>Fitbit users can simply record their steps with a device in
        their pocket, they can use it to sync data to the company’s hosted
        application, they can visit the portal to see their statistics and
        share them with friends, they can manually enter sleep and food data
        to augment what’s collected passively, and they can buy the premium
        Fitbit offering to help them reach their health goals.</p><p>Each of these use models represents a different tier of
        engagement, and Fitbit could segment users across these five segments.
        And it should: it’s perfectly acceptable for a Fitbit user to only use
        the clip-on device to record the number of steps taken per day,
        without ever uploading that information, but as a result the company
        won’t be able to monetize that user beyond the initial purchase
        (through on-site ads, premium subscriptions, or selling aggregate user
        data, for example). The value of that user is significantly lower.
        Predicting revenues accurately relies on an understanding of how its
        different user segments employ the product.</p><p>As a startup, you have a wide range of payment and incentive
        models from which to choose: freemium, free trial, pay up-front,
        discount, ad-funded, and so on. Your choice needs to match the kind of
        segmentation you’re doing, the time it takes for a user to become a
        paying customer, how easy it <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1010"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1128"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1131"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1933"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1991"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2078"/>is to use your service, and how costly an additional
        drive-by user is to the business.</p><p>Not all customers are good. Don’t fall victim to customer
        counting. Instead, optimize for <span class="emphasis"><em>good</em></span> customers
        and segment your activities based on the kinds of customer those
        activities attract.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The Business Model Flipbook"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="business_model_flipbook" style="clear: both">The Business Model Flipbook</h2></div></div></div><p>A product is more than the thing you buy. It’s the mix of
        service, branding, fame, street cred, support, packaging, and myriad
        other factors you pay for. When you purchase an iPhone, you’re also
        getting a tiny piece of Steve Jobs’s persona.</p><p>In the same way, a business model is a combination of things.
        It’s what you sell, how you deliver it, how you acquire customers, and
        how you make money from them.</p><p>Many people blur these dimensions of a business model. We’re
        guilty of it, too. Freemium isn’t a business model—it’s a marketing
        tactic. SaaS isn’t a business model—it’s a way of delivering software.
        The ads on a media site aren’t a business model—they’re a way of
        collecting revenue.</p><p>Later in the book we’re going to outline six sample businesses.
        But before we do that, we want to talk about how we came up with them.
        Think of one of the flipbooks you had as a kid—the kind where you
        could combine different body parts on each page to make different
        characters.</p><p>You can build business models this way, but instead of heads,
        torsos, and feet, you have several aspects of a business: the
        acquisition channel, selling tactic, revenue source, product type, and
        delivery model.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>acquisition channel</strong></span>
            is how people find out about you.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>selling tactic</strong></span> is how
            you convince visitors to become users or users to become
            customers. Generally, you either ask for money or you provide some
            kind of scarcity or exclusivity—such as a time limit, a capacity
            limit, the removal of ads, additional functionality, or the desire
            to keep things to themselves—to convince them to act.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>revenue source</strong></span> is
            simply how you make money. Money can come from your customers
            directly (through a payment) or indirectly (through advertising,
            referrals, analysis of their behavior, content creation, and so
            on). It can include transactions, subscriptions, consumption-based
            billing charges, ad revenue, resale of data, donations, and much
            more.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>product type</strong></span> is what
            value your business offers in return for the revenue.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1312"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2134"/>The <span class="strong"><strong>delivery
            model</strong></span> is how you get your product to the
            customer.</p></li></ul></div><p><a class="xref" href="ch07.html#just_like_the_flipbooks_you_had_as_a_kid" title="Figure 7-1. Just like the flipbooks you had as a kid, with more words">Figure 7-1</a>
        shows these five aspects, with a variety of models and examples for
        each one. Remember that this is only a set of examples—most businesses
        will rely on several acquisition channels, or experiment with
        different revenue models, or try various sales tactics.</p><div class="figure"><a id="just_like_the_flipbooks_you_had_as_a_kid"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00013"/><img alt="Just like the flipbooks you had as a kid, with more words" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989271.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 7-1. Just like the flipbooks you had as a kid, with more
          words</div></div><div class="sect2" title="Lots to Choose From"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="lots_to_choose_from">Lots to Choose From</h3></div></div></div><p>There is an abundance of “pages” you can put into the
          flipbook. The team at Startup Compass, a startup dedicated to
          helping companies make better business decisions with data,
          identifies 12 revenue models: advertising, consulting, data, lead
          generation, licensing fee, listing fee, ownership/hardware, rental,
          sponsorship, subscription, transaction fee, and virtual goods.
          Venture capitalist Fred Wilson has a document listing a vast number
          <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1129"/>of web and mobile revenue models, many of which are
          variants on six basic ones we’ll list later in the book.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch07fn04" id="ch07fn04">24</a>]</sup></p><p>Startup Compass also suggests some “fundamental” financial
          models that combine several pages from the flipbook: search, gaming,
          social network, new media, marketplace, video, commerce, rental,
          subscription, audio, lead generation, hardware, and payments.</p><p>You can use these “pages” to create a back-of-the-napkin
          business model. For example, <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#turning_the_flipbook_pages_to_dropbox" title="Figure 7-2. Turning the flipbook pages to Dropbox">Figure 7-2</a> shows a sample
          business model flipbook for Dropbox.</p><div class="figure"><a id="turning_the_flipbook_pages_to_dropbox"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00014"/><img alt="Turning the flipbook pages to Dropbox" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989272.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 7-2. Turning the flipbook pages to Dropbox</div></div><p>There’s another advantage of stating business models in a
          flipbook structure like this: it encourages lateral thinking. Each
          turn of a “page” is a pivot: what would it mean to offer Dropbox as
          a physical delivery? Or to charge up front for it? Or to rely on
          paid advertising?</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Six Business Models"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="six_business_models" style="clear: both">Six Business Models</h2></div></div></div><p>In the coming chapters, we’re going to look at six business
        models. Each model is a blend of these aspects, and we’ve tried to mix
        them up enough to give you a taste of some common examples. But just
        like a kid’s flipbook, there’s a huge variety: from the aforementioned
        list, there are over 6,000 permutations, and our list of aspects isn’t
        by any means exhaustive.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1130"/>As if that weren’t confusing enough, you can employ
        several at once: Amazon is a transactional, physical-delivery, SEM
        (search engine marketing), simple-purchase retailer, but it’s also
        running sub-businesses such as user-generated content in the form of
        product reviews. So unlike those relatively simple children’s books,
        your business can quite easily be a many-headed monster.</p><p>In the face of this complexity, we’ve decided to keep our six
        business models simple. We’ll talk about several aspects of those
        businesses, and the metrics that matter most to companies of each
        sort. Think of it as opening the business model flipbook to a
        particular “page”—one in which you see elements of your own
