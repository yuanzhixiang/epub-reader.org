      that help us understand startups and the changes they undergo as they
      grow, find their markets, and help startups acquire customers and
      revenue. Each framework offers a different perspective on the startup
      lifecycle, and each suggests a set of metrics and areas on which to
      focus.</p><p>After comparing and contrasting a number of these frameworks,
      we’ve created our own way to think about startups, and in particular the
      metrics that you use to measure your progress. We’ll use this new
      framework throughout the book—but first, let’s take a look at some of
      the existing frameworks and how they fit into Lean Analytics.</p><div class="sect1" title="Dave McClure’s Pirate Metrics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="dave_mcclureapostrophes_pirate_metrics" style="clear: both">Dave McClure’s Pirate Metrics</h2></div></div></div><p>Pirate Metrics—a term coined by venture capitalist Dave

        about three engines that drive the growth of a startup. Each of these
        has associated <span class="emphasis"><em>key performance indicators</em></span>
        (KPIs).</p><div class="sect2" title="Sticky Engine"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="sticky_engine">Sticky Engine</h3></div></div></div><p>The sticky engine focuses on getting users to return, and to
          keep using your product. It’s akin to Dave McClure’s retention
          phase. If your users aren’t sticky, churn will be high, and you
          won’t have engagement. Engagement is one of the best predictors of
          success: Facebook’s early user counts weren’t huge, but the company
          could get nearly all students in a university to use the product,
          and to keep coming back, within a few months of launch. Facebook’s
          stickiness was off the charts.</p><p>The fundamental KPI for stickiness is customer retention.
          Churn rates and usage frequency are other important metrics to
          track. Long-term stickiness often comes from the value users create
          for themselves as they use the service. It’s hard for people to
          leave Gmail or Evernote, because, well, that’s where they store all
          their stuff. Similarly, if a player deletes his account from a
          massively multiplayer online game (MMO), he loses all his status and
          in-game items, which he’s worked hard to earn.</p><p>Stickiness isn’t only about retention, it’s also about
          frequency, which is why you also need to track metrics like time
          since last visit. If you have methods of driving return visits such
          as email notifications or updates, then email open rates and
          click-through rates matter, too.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Virality Engine"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="virality_engine">Virality Engine</h3></div></div></div><p>Virality is all about getting the word out. Virality is
          attractive because it compounds—if every user adds another 1.5
          users, your user base will grow infinitely until you’ve saturated
          all users.<sup>[<a class="footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#ftn.ch05fn02" id="ch05fn02">17</a>]</sup></p><p>The key metric for this engine is the <span class="emphasis"><em>viral
          coefficient</em></span>—the number of new users that each user brings
          on. Because this is compounding (the users they bring, in turn,
          bring their own users), the metric measures how many users are
          brought in with each viral cycle. Growth comes from a viral
          coefficient of greater than one, but you also have to factor in
          churn and loss. The bigger the coefficient, the faster you
          grow.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1146"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1228"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1521"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1608"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1662"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1682"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1856"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2286"/>Measuring viral coefficient isn’t enough. You also
          need to measure the actions that make up the cycle. For example,
          when you join most social networks, you’re asked to connect to your
          email account to find contacts, then you’re given the option to
          invite them. They receive emails, which they might act upon. Those
          distinct stages all contribute to virality, so measuring actions is
          how you tweak the viral engine—by changing the message, simplifying
          the signup process, and so on.</p><p>There are other factors at play with virality as well,
          including the speed with which a user invites another (known as the
          <span class="emphasis"><em>viral cycle time</em></span>) and the type of virality.
          We’ll dive into these later in the book.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Paid Engine"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="paid_engine">Paid Engine</h3></div></div></div><p>The third engine of growth is payment. It’s usually premature
          to turn this engine on before you know that your product is sticky
          and viral. Meteor Entertainment’s <span class="emphasis"><em>Hawken</em></span> is a
          multiplayer game that’s free to play, but it makes money from
          in-game upgrades. Meteor is focusing on usage within a beta group
          first (stickiness), then working on virality (inviting your friends
          to play), and finally payment (players buying upgrades to become
          competitive or enhance the in-game experience).</p><p>Getting paid is, in some ways, the ultimate metric for
          identifying a sustainable business model. If you make more money
          from customers than it costs you to acquire them—and you do so
          consistently—you’re sustainable. You don’t need money from external
          investors, and you’re growing shareholder equity every day.</p><p>But getting paid, on its own, isn’t an engine of growth. It’s
          just a way to put money in the bank. Revenue helps growth only when
          you funnel some of the money generated from revenue back into
          acquisition. Then you have a machine that you can tune to grow the
          business over time.</p><p>The two knobs on this machine are <span class="emphasis"><em>customer lifetime
          value</em></span> (CLV) and <span class="emphasis"><em>customer acquisition
          cost</em></span> (CAC). Making more money from customers than you
          spend acquiring them is good, but the equation for success isn’t
          that simple. You still need to worry about cash flow and growth
          rate, which are driven by how long it takes a customer to pay off.
          One way to measure this is <span class="emphasis"><em>time to customer
          breakeven</em></span>—that is, how much time it will take to recoup
          the acquisition cost of a customer.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Ash Maurya’s Lean Canvas"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="ash_mauryaapostrophes_lean_canvas" style="clear: both">Ash Maurya’s Lean Canvas</h2></div></div></div><p>We looked at the Lean Canvas in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Deciding What to Do with Your Life">Chapter 3</a>, when we talked about
        deciding what problem you should solve. See the sidebar <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#how_to_use_a_lean_canvas" title="How to Use a Lean Canvas">How to Use a Lean Canvas</a> for some tips on putting it into

          update the Lean Canvas continuously. It’s a “living, breathing”
          plan, not a hypothetical tome of nonsense that you throw out the
          minute you start actually working on your startup. Once you’ve
          filled out the Lean Canvas (or most of it), you start running
          experiments to validate or invalidate what you’ve
          hypothesized.</p><p>In its simplest form, think of each box as a “pass/fail”:if
          your experiments fail, you don’t go to the next box; rather, you
          keep experimenting until you hit a wall completely or get to the
          next step. The only exception is the “Key metrics” box, which is
          meant to keep a record of the most important metrics you’re
          tracking. You don’t run experiments on this box, but it’s important
          to fill it out anyway because it’s definitely open to debate and
          discussion.</p></div><p>Each of the boxes in Ash’s canvas has relevant metrics you need
        to track, as outlined in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#lean_canvas_and_relevant_metrics" title="Table 5-2. Lean Canvas and relevant metrics">Table 5-2</a> (the canvas actually has
        a box for metrics, which should get updated each time you focus on
        something different in the canvas). These metrics either tie your
        one-page business model to reality by confirming each box, or they
        send you back to the drawing board. The individual metrics may change
        depending on your type of business, but the guidelines are valuable
        just the same. We’ll share more details later in the book on the key
        metrics that matter based on your type of business, as well as

He coined
        the term <span class="emphasis"><em>growth hacker</em></span> and has been heavily
        involved with a number of meteoric-growth startups, including Dropbox,
        Xobni, LogMeIn (IPO), and Uproar (IPO). His Startup Growth Pyramid,

        you can send customers (available at <span class="emphasis"><em>survey.io</em></span>)
        to determine if you’re ready for accelerated growth. The most
        important question in the survey is “How would you feel if you could
        no longer use this product or service?” In Sean’s experience, if 40%
        of people (or more) say they’d be very disappointed to lose the
        service, you’ve found a fit, and now it’s time to scale.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The Long Funnel"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="long_funnel" style="clear: both">The Long Funnel</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1256"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1493"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1633"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2116"/>In the early days of the Web, transactional websites had
        relatively simple conversion funnels. Visitors came to the home page,
        navigated to the product they wanted, entered payment information, and
        confirmed their order.</p><p>No more. Today’s funnel extends well beyond the front door of a
        website, across myriad social networks, sharing platforms, affiliates,
        and price-comparison sites. Both offline and online factors influence
        a single purchase. Customers may make several tentative visits prior
        to a conversion.</p><p>We call this the Long Funnel. It’s a way of understanding how
        you first come to someone’s attention, and the journey she takes from
        that initial awareness through to a goal you want her to complete
        (such as making a purchase, creating content, or sharing a message).
        Often, measuring a long funnel involves injecting some kind of
        tracking into the initial signal, so you can follow the user as she

        launching the Lean Analytics Book website.<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch05fn03" id="ch05fn03">18</a>]</sup> We didn’t have a hard “goal” such as a purchase, but we
        did have a number of things we wanted visitors to do: sign up for our
        mailing list, click on the book cover, and take a survey. By creating
        custom URLs for our proponents to share, we injected a signal into the
        start of the Long Funnel, and were able to see how our message
        spread.</p><p>We learned, for example, that author and speaker Julien Smith’s
        followers were less likely to fill out the survey than Eric Ries’s and
        Avinash Kaushik’s followers, unless they were returning visitors, in
        which case they were more likely to do so. This kind of insight can
        help us choose the right kind of proponent for future promotional
        efforts.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The Lean Analytics Stages and Gates"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="lean_analytics_stages_and_gates" style="clear: both">The Lean Analytics Stages and Gates</h2></div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1371"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1604"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1994"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2044"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2144"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2300"/>Having reviewed these frameworks, we needed a model that
        identified the distinct stages a startup usually goes through, and
        what the “gating” metrics should be that indicate it’s time to move to
        the next stage. The five stages we identified are Empathy, Stickiness,
        Virality, Revenue, and Scale. We believe most startups go through
        these stages, and in order to move from one to the next they need to
        achieve certain goals with respect to the metrics they’re
        tracking.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch05.html#frameworkscomma_frameworks_everywhere" title="Figure 5-5. Frameworks, frameworks everywhere">Figure 5-5</a> shows
        the stages and gates of Lean Analytics, and how this model lines up
        with the other frameworks. A good portion of the book is structured by
        our stages, so it’s important to understand how this works.</p><div class="figure"><a id="frameworkscomma_frameworks_everywhere"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00012"/><img alt="Frameworks, frameworks everywhere" src="httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1989270.png"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 5-5. Frameworks, frameworks everywhere</div></div><p>Ultimately, there are a number of good frameworks that help you
        think about your business.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Some, like Pirate Metrics and the Long Funnel, focus on the
            act of acquiring and converting customers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Others, like the Engines of Growth and the Startup Growth
            Pyramid, offer strategies for knowing when or how to grow.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Some, like the Lean Canvas, help you map out the components
            of your business model so you can evaluate them independent of one
            another.</p></li></ul></div><p>We’re proposing a new model called the Lean Analytics Stages,
        which draws from the best of these models and puts an emphasis on
        metrics. It identifies five distinct stages startups go through as
        they grow.</p><p>While we believe the Lean Analytics Stages represent a fairly
        simple framework for understanding your startup’s progress, we
        recognize that it can still look overwhelming. And even with our
        framework, you’ll still use the other frameworks as well, so there’s a
        lot to digest. That’s why you should put all of this aside (for now!)
        and focus on the One Metric That Matters, which we’ll cover in the
        next chapter.</p></div><div class="footnotes" epub:type="footnotes"><br/><hr style="width: 100; align: left;"/><div class="footnote" id="ftn.ch05fn01"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#ch05fn01">16</a>] </sup><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version" target="_top">http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version</a></em></span></p></div><div class="footnote" epub:type="footnote" id="ftn.ch05fn02"><p><sup>[<a class="para" href="#ch05fn02">17</a>] </sup>It’s never really this simple; churn, competitors, and
