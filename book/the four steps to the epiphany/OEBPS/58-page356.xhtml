<p class="noind20"><i>Goal of Phase 3d:</i> Industry analysts are part of the foundation of credibility that a startup needs - for mainstream customers to feel safe in buying, and as key references for the press. The goal is to meet with industry analysts; get their insight and feedback on your initial positioning (market, product and company); and their thoughts on your product features.</p>
