<p class="noind20"><i>Goal of Phase 2a:</i> In Customer Discovery you visited customers to understand their problems and to see if the product concept solved that problem. Now you want to find “visionaries” and sell to them. Visionaries are the only customers able to buy an unfinished product that has yet to be delivered. They understand they have a problem and have visualized a solution that looks like yours. You may have called on some visionaries in your previous phases, or you may have to find new ones.</p>
