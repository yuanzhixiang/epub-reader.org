<p class="noind20"><i>Goal of Phase 2c:</i> Develop a deep understanding of a customer, how they work, their pain, and where it is felt. This first customer meeting is a “give-and-take”: you have to give something for them to feel that it’s worth a meeting. In exchange for them talking to you, you will share your problem presentation. You might carry a tape recorder and a notebook, or bring a digital camera and take pictures of the whiteboard as you make notes. Your goal is NOT to pitch your product but to validate your understanding of the problem.</p>
