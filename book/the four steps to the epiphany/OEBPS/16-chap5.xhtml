<div class="blockquote">
	<p class="center20"><i>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.</i></p>
	<p class="center">— <i>Ecclesiastes 3:1</i></p>
</div>
<p class="noind40">P<small>HOTOS</small>T<small>O</small>Y<small>OU</small> <small>WAS</small> <small>A</small> <small>PRESCIENT</small> <small>IDEA</small>. Way before others saw the opportunity in the late 1990s, Ernie, Chen, and Dave, the founders of PhotosToYou, realized that sales of digital cameras were starting to take off. Back then, the only way to see digital pictures was to print them out at home. It dawned on Ernie, Chen, and Dave there was an opportunity for a service to provide photo printing for digital pictures via the Internet. Not just the type of prints one would get from a low-end ink jet printer at home, but 35 mm-quality prints from high-quality photofinishing equipment. PhotosToYou would then mail the prints directly to customers.</p>
<p class="ind">When PhotosToYou was founded, the photography market was in rapid transition from film-based to digital. At the time, 82 billion photos were being taken annually<a id="page158"/> with traditional cameras, and more than $37 billion was being spent to develop those photos. At the same time, sales of digital cameras were starting to skyrocket. Growing at a rate of over 50% annually, the installed base of digital cameras was projected to be 25% of the consumer camera market by 2004. In fact, as PhotosToYou got started, digital cameras were projected to be one of the top two consumer electronics sellers over the next three holiday seasons. To the founders, digital photography without an easy “finishing” solution seemed like computers without printers. They were convinced convenient online printing was the “killer application” for digital cameras.</p>
<p class="ind">I met Ernie, Chen, and Dave when PhotosToYou was just the three of them and they were still working out of the small offices of their lead investor. I was giving them a hand trying to understand the digital photography market. In talking to digital camera owners, we found they loved digital cameras for the convenience and immediate gratification, but regretted giving up quality prints. They used the digital camera when they wanted to take photos they could view immediately (or share online), but they still carried their 35 mm camera to capture photos they could turn into lasting memories. If they could get 35 mm prints from their digital camera, it would be the only camera they would use. Until then, it was a two-camera world.</p>
<p class="ind">Fast-forward a year. PhotosToYou hired a talented team of imaging experts from the photo industry as well as leading universities. The company had developed color correction and image enhancement technology that optimized prints for specific digital camera models. It had built the first all-digital print process using digital printers and an entire digital production facility. And it had created an incredibly easy Web application to upload and order photos. Supporting all of that were customer service, order tracking, and email and phone support. PhotosToYou was in the process of creating long-term strategic partnerships. And like any good startup it was worried about the 800-pound gorilla—in this case, Kodak—as well as the swarm of competitors that had emerged. But PhotosToYou was in good shape. Digital cameras were selling well, the company had raised a pile of money, and beta customers liked the product and were starting to tell their friends about the service. The founders were on the brink of launching the company and its online photofinishing service.</p>
<p class="ind">So what could go wrong? For PhotosToYou the trouble started when the company hired a new CEO and VP of Marketing, both passionate believers in “branding.”</p>
<p class="ind">PhotosToYou’s new executive team believed the difference between winning and losing on the Internet was “brand,” and they wanted PhotosToYou to be the first company to<a id="page159"/> develop a brand associated with digital photo printing. They believed a strong brand would allow them to drive end-user demand to their website and grab market share early on that they would never relinquish. The marketing department quickly translated this theory into practice by executing branding on multiple levels. The goal was to hit customers with the PhotosToYou brand at stores when they bought the camera, again through the company’s digital camera and photofinisher partners, and yet again in their mailboxes. To make this happen PhotosToYou would have to get deals with retailers, digital camera manufacturers, Internet community sites and photo portals. The branding strategy also included a national, broad-based advertising campaign as well as targeted advertising. A large and expensive corporate identity program began.</p>
<p class="ind">Then reality set in. The PhotosToYou partnership strategy, which sounded great in the conference room, didn’t happen. Digital camera manufacturers were reluctant to partner with just one digital photofinisher. The large Internet portals like AOL and Yahoo were more than happy to do a deal, but PhotosToYou would have to pay them a ton of money up front. The same was true for the deals with the PC manufacturers and retailers. Sure, some of them would be happy to bundle the PhotosToYou software with their PCs, but it was going to cost PhotosToYou a bundle. This left advertising and promotions as the one sure thing the company could control. So PhotosToYou embarked on a national advertising campaign.</p>
<p class="ind">What do you think of the company’s strategy at this point? Does it make sense? Was PhotosToYou on the narrow path to success or the broad road to disaster? Was “branding” the answer to the challenge the company faced in introducing its product? What would an alternative strategy look like?</p>
<p class="ind">If you’ve followed the line of reasoning of this book to this point, you might guess the answers to these questions. PhotosToYou’s strategy might have made sense in an existing market, but not for a startup in a new market. Not understanding Market Type almost sank PhotosToYou. In fact, once you understand how Market Type affects Customer Creation activities, you’ll understand why the mistakes PhotosToYou made are taught as a case study in my business school class. PhotosToYou did not need a branding strategy. It needed a set of rules to identify its Market Type, and apply the appropriate Customer Creation strategies and tactics. Those strategies are the focus of the Customer Creation step. In the rest of this chapter, you’ll find out what went wrong at PhotosToYou and how to avoid making the same mistakes.</p>
<h3 class="center20" id="page160">The Customer Creation Philosophy</h3>
<p class="noind20">As part of the marketing advisory board at PhotosToYou, I listened to the company’s launch, rollout, and branding strategies emerge. It seemed to me the company was making several mistakes.</p>
<p class="ind">First, in being so exclusively focused on branding tactics and launch, the company ignored the fundamental discussion of which kind of market PhotosToYou was in. No one had stopped to consider whether the company was entering an existing market, resegmenting an existing market or creating a new market. (Remember our Market Type definitions from <a href="8-chap2.xhtml#chap2">Chapter 2</a>; you’re in a new market when you enable customers to do something they couldn’t do before.)</p>
<p class="ind">The only people who could be PhotosToYou customers were digital camera customers. Therefore, the company’s revenue was bounded by the size and growth of the new digital camera market. I argued even if they acquired 100% of all the digital camera customers with high-speed Internet access it wouldn’t matter, because there were so few of them (remember this was in 1999). Since we were creating a new market, I suggested that the PhotosToYou business would take three to five years to develop. For the next two years, their market growth would be limited by outside factors (digital camera and broadband Internet adoption rate) and this was going to be a long-term war, not a short-term grab for nonexistent market share. The relevance of this argument to their marketing and branding strategy was that in a new market, spending money early to grab market share was a very bad idea. A consumer choice in this area wasn’t permanent (as early customers were likely to experiment with multiple photo printing sites), and next year, when there would be eight times as many available customers, PhotosToYou wouldn’t have the marketing dollars to reach them. I suggested that, rather than start expensive demand-creation activities now, PhotosToYou preserve its huge pile of cash and hunker down for the long term. Instead of a huge formal onslaught launch, they should implement an early adopter launch.</p>
<p class="ind">I also offered that in a new market the first year’s marketing communication goals should be focused on fostering market adoption, not market share, and the company’s demand-creation activities should be low-cost attempts to educate customers about the new online photofinishing market, not hugely expensive customer acquisition programs for the few customers who existed at that time. My belief was in a new market, only the early adopters—the earlyvangelists—will find the product and spread the word.</p>
<p class="ind">The PhotosToYou executives didn’t get it. “Why are you telling us about this different <a id="page161"/>Market Type stuff? It has nothing to do with how we launch and promote our products. We’ve always done it this way in big companies and startups.”</p>
<p class="ind">Trust me, this is not the advice you want to give to young, high-testosterone marketers—particularly ones being encouraged by even higher testosterone board members whose mantra was “get big fast.” The board and the marketing executives thought I just didn’t get it. So, my recommendations notwithstanding, the PhotosToYou marketing spending machine started like it was in an existing market and, like a steamroller going downhill, there was no stopping it.</p>
<p class="ind">The result was predictable. As the outside advertising and PR service providers pocketed the company’s money, PhotosToYou burned through its large pile of venture money in the first two years. While the company had customer growth that would have been impressive by most metrics, it was nowhere near its optimistic revenue projections, and customer-acquisition costs were sky-high. In addition, customers proved to be fickle as they tested each online photo finishing service. Customer churn and retention turned out to be equally as important as customer acquisition. Consequently, PhotosToYou was forced to go back to the market for more money during one of the worst downturns in the technology business.</p>
<p class="ind">Luckily, the company’s solid (but small) customer base saved it. PhotosToYou found new investors, albeit after a “cram-down” financing round - one in which the investors valued the company at one-tenth of its previous value, thereby dramatically diminishing the percentage ownership of earlier investors. In addition, the new investors insisted it replace the entire executive staff (including Ernie, Chen, and Dave), banish the nebulous term “branding” from its lexicon, and focus on the basic blocking, tackling, and execution of a more mature digital camera photofinishing business.</p>
<p class="ind">The story of PhotosToYou is a cautionary tale of what can go wrong in customer creation. Now let’s take a look at the thinking behind this key step.</p>
<h3 class="left20">Customer Creation Versus Marketing Communications Execution</h3>
<p class="noind">In the Customer Development model, the phrase “customer creation” represents the essential marketing activities necessary to help customers learn about a product and create a desire to buy it. In most startups this job falls under the general rubric of marketing communication. I call these activities Customer Creation rather than marketing communication to make the points that (1) in a startup these events are occurring for the first time; (2) they are not about the marketing department, they are about customers; (3) they are creation events, not follow-on execution activities;<a id="page162"/> and (4) the types of appropriate marketing programs differ widely, depending on Market Type.</p>
<p class="ind">Why is this distinction important? Traditional marketing communications strategy has six elements: (1) an internal and external PR audit to understand customer perceptions, (2) development of a unique company and product positioning, (3) enlistment of key industry influencers and recommenders, (4) recruitment of enthusiastic beta customers ready to sing the praises of the product, (5) product launch at first customer ship, and (6) ramped-up demand creation spending (advertising, public relations, trade shows, etc.). However, the implicit assumption is that all startups are in existing markets. And these six steps work in every existing market. However, in at least two of the four types of startups these traditional rules don’t work. Unfortunately, in lieu of developing a strategy that fits their own particular circumstances, most startup marketers tend to fall back on timeworn marketing phrases and programs, typically those they used at their last company. This is a mistake. Launching a new product and company should not be confused with executing a laundry list of marketing tactics. What every startup needs is a thoughtful Customer Creation strategy and plan tailored to their Market Type. My emphasis on Customer Creation rather than marketing communications execution is meant to make clear the people involved need to be strategists rather than tacticians.</p>
<p class="ind">To develop a successful Customer Creation strategy, you must answer two questions: (1) What type of startup are you? (2) What are your positioning messages (based on your deep understanding of who the customers are and what they want)?</p>
<p class="ind">In Customer Discovery and Validation you identified who will buy your product and acquired extensive information about those customers. In Customer Creation you will use that information to forge a strategy—not disconnected tactics—to reach customers.</p>
<h3 class="left20">Market Typing: The Four Types of Startups</h3>
<p class="noind">In Customer Discovery and Validation you began to consider what <a href="http://steveblank.com/2009/09/10/customer-development-manifesto-part-4/">Market Type</a> your startup is entering. (Existing, Resegmented Low End, Resegmented Niche, or New Market.) Now in Customer Creation, you need to definitively answer that question. Market Type determines how you shape your Customer Creation strategy. It is the source of all the company’s positioning activities. (Keep in mind that Market Type is not immutable - you may have lots of leeway in positioning. For example, almost every product that fits as a product in an existing market could be positioned as a niche in a resegmented market. And every product that first looks like it’s in a new market has to be positioned there.)</p>
<div class="figure">
	<p class="center" id="page163"><a id="table5_1"/><img alt="" src="images/table_5_1.jpg"/></p>
	<p class="caption"><i><b>Types of Markets</b> (Table 5.1)</i></p>
</div>
<p class="ind">Choosing your Market Type starts with a review of everything you have learned about your potential customers in the Customer Discovery and Validation steps. By now, you should have a pretty good handle on customer needs. In talking to and selling to early customers, you have also discovered who else is trying to satisfy those same needs. Now you consider all your qualitative analyses and quantitative research about the market and your competitors. With these data in hand, take a look at <a href="#table5_1">Table 5.1</a>, the four types of markets, and see where your product fits best.</p>
<h4 class="left20">New Lanchester Strategy</h4>
<p class="noind">One of the best tools I’ve found for sorting out Market Type choices is derived from a military operations research theory called the New Lanchester Strategy. (These ideas have been put to use in marketing strategy in Japan, but they have always lost something in the translation by the time they have arrived in the United States. I don’t swear I can derive the New Lanchester formulas and prove the theorems, but the results when applied to markets come out looking uncannily like the real world.) The New Lanchester Strategy suggests a few simple rules companies can use to analyze an existing market:</p>
<ul class="disc">
	<li>If a single company has 74% of the market, the market has become an effective monopoly. For a startup, that’s an unassailable position for a head-on assault. (Think Microsoft.)</li>
	<li>If the combined market share for the market leader and second-ranking company<a id="page164"/> is greater than 74% and the first company is within 1.7 times the share of the second, it means the market is held by a duopoly. This is also an unassailable position for a startup to attack. (In the telecom sector, Cisco and Juniper’s share of the core router market fits this description.)</li>
	<li>If a company has 41% market share and at least 1.7 times the market share of the next largest company, it is the market leader. For a startup, this, too, is a very difficult market to enter. Markets with a clear market leader are, for a startup, an opportunity for resegementation.</li>
	<li>If the biggest player in a market has at least a 26% market share, the market is unstable, with a strong possibility of abrupt shifts in the company rankings. Here there may be some entry opportunities.</li>
	<li>If the biggest player has less than 26% market share, it has no real impact in influencing the market. Startups that want to enter an existing market find these the easiest to penetrate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ind20">One more rule in the New Lanchester Strategy is relevant for a startup. If you decide to attack a market that has just one dominant player, be prepared to spend three times the combined sales and marketing budget of that dominant player. (Ouch, so much for going head-on with Microsoft.) In a market that has multiple participants, the cost of entry is lower, but you still need to spend 1.7 times the combined sales and marketing budget of the company you plan to attack. (To enter an existing market you must steal market share from an incumbent, hence the analogy to war.) <a href="#table5_2">Table 5.2</a> summarizes the market cost of entry.</p>
<div class="figure">
	<p class="center"><a id="table5_2"/><img alt="" src="images/149_img01.jpg"/></p>
	<p class="caption"><i><b>Market Cost of Entry</b> (Table 5.2)</i></p>
</div>
<p class="ind" id="page165">Thinking about this strategy, many of the rules marketers learn painfully in the field now make a lot more sense. In looking at any existing market, your startup is the weakest player with the least resources. Therefore, attacking the strongest players head-on is foolish. You want to choose strategies that acknowledge your weaknesses and play to your agility. (Both <a href="http://www.mdv.com/who-we-are/bill-davidow">Bill Davidow</a> in his seminal work <i>High Technology Marketing</i> and <a href="http://www.geoffreyamoore.com/">Geoff Moore</a> in <i>Crossing the Chasm</i> articulated the same type of rules for startups and new products based on observation and experience. Now we can derive them directly.)</p>
<p class="ind">Now that you know the rules, what do they mean for choosing Market Type? Let’s say you are going after a well-defined existing market. If there is a dominant player with more than 74% market share, do not attack that market head-on. Why? Because of the rule that says you need three times the resources of the market leader, you’ll be out of business shortly. Instead, target your attack at the point where your limited resources can make a difference. You will segment the existing market to create a submarket where your product can be unique or substantially different. Or if you can create an entirely new market; you can define a space the market leader does not address.</p>
<p class="ind">Your goal is to become No. 1 in something important to your customer. It could be product attribute, territory, distribution chain/retailer, or customer base. Keep segmenting the market (by age, income, region, etc.) and focusing on the competitors’ weak points until you have a battle you can win. You know your segmentation is correct when you have created a niche where you can be No. 1. Remember, any company can take customers away from any other company—if it can define the battle.</p>
<p class="ind">If the dominant player has between 26% and 74% market share, pick your battles carefully. Remember the cost of a head-on attack: Three times the budget of a single competitor or 1.7 times a competitor in a crowded market. Most startups don’t have access to those financial resources. Therefore, resegmenting the market or creating a new market is almost always the default when faced with a dominant incumbent. All the marketing tricks for nipping at the heels of an entrenched competitor can be used here: Most of them were invented 2,500 years ago by Sun Tzu’ and described in his book, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War">The Art of War</a>:</i> “All warfare is based on deception. If your enemy is superior evade him. If angry irritate him. If equally matched, fight and if not split and re-evaluate.”</p>
<p class="ind">If there is no single company with more than 26% market share in an existing market, then the startup gods have smiled on you. You can still choose to resegment the market, but the cost of entry is low and the market is ripe for innovation. It is yours to lose.</p>
<p class="ind">What if there are no competitors? What if after talking to all your early customers you<a id="page166"/> continue to hear, “There’s nothing else like what your company is offering?” What if after looking at all the quantitative data you can’t find other companies with comparable products? Congratulations: You are creating an entirely new market. A company creating a new market is radically different from one entering or reframing an existing market. While there are no market-share battles with competitors, there are also no existing customers. This means even an infinite demand-creation budget at the point of product launch will not garner market share. Creating a new market is about long-term customer education and adoption.</p>
<p class="ind">Given the long-term and deep-pocket commitment necessary in a new market, why not just position the company as one resgementing an existing market? That can be a viable option, but the one piece of great news about creating an entirely new market is once the market is established, as the market leader you are guaranteed at least 41% market share. You can certainly lose that share, and your success will attract other competitors, but the market is yours to start. (The notion of a new market is also tantalizing because of the misunderstood and much-abused phrase “first mover advantage.” We’ll talk about that later in this chapter.)</p>
<p class="ind">With the tantalizing goal of dominance of a new market in mind (dominant players set the standards, pricing and positioning), I’ll add one final rule: Startups creating new markets will not create a market of substantial size to generate a profit until three to seven years from product launch. This sobering piece of data is derived from looking at the results of hundreds of high-tech startups in the last 20 years. While you may be convinced your startup is the exception, the odds say unless you are in a <a href="http://steveblank.com/2011/06/15/the-next-bubble-dont-get-fooled-again/">“bubble economy”</a> it takes time for new ideas and products to diffuse and catch on. (A bubble economy is defined as a time of irrational exuberance in a market when all normal rules are repealed. Examples include the biotech boom in the early 1980s and the dot-com and telecom boom in the late 1990s.) With the rules governing the four types of markets for startups in hand, let’s examine how fundamental the choice of Market Type is to this Customer Creation step.</p>
<h3 class="left20">Customer Creation Strategies to Match Market Type</h3>
<p class="noind">Now that we understand a bit about Market Type, it’s hard to believe that with monotonous regularity startups with no revenue still announce new products using the same positioning and product launch strategy as a billion-dollar, 75-year-old company announcing its 43rd follow-on product. This disconnect contributes to the high-burn rate and less-than-dazzling market penetration of more than a few startups. In a forgiving<a id="page167"/> economy, heaps of funding will hide these problems, but when money is scarce, getting it right the first time matters. And that means matching your positioning, launch, and demand-creation strategies to the type of startup you are.</p>
<p class="ind">The big idea is since there are existing, resegmented and new Market Types, there must be Customer Creation strategies to match. More specifically, each building block of customer creation—company and product positioning, company and product launch, demand-creation activities, and first-year goals—differs depending on the type of startup. These are radical new ideas, and their consequences are a bit sobering. There isn’t just one type of product launch for a startup; there are three. There isn’t just one type of positioning; there are three. There isn’t just one type of demand-creation activity; there are three. And there isn’t just one appropriate first-year goal; there are three. (<a href="#table5_3">Table 5.3</a> summarizes the Customer Creation building blocks for the three types of startups; the rest of this chapter elaborates on the details.)</p>
<div class="figure">
	<p class="center"><a id="table5_3"/><img alt="" src="images/other05.jpg"/></p>
	<p class="caption"><i><b>Customer Creation Activities for the Three Types of Startups</b> (Table 5.3)</i></p>
</div>
<p class="ind">In hindsight, it’s obvious that PhotosToYou did not understand Market Types. If the founders had understood they had a new product entering a new market, their choices for Customer Creation would have been a lot clearer.</p>
<h3 class="left20">The Four Building Blocks of Customer Creation</h3>
<p class="noind">Common to all startups are four building blocks for Customer Creation. Being able to articulate them is the first step in assembling a coherent Customer Creation plan. The<a id="page168"/> four building blocks are:</p>
<ul class="disc">
	<li>Year one objectives</li>
	<li>Positioning: both company and product</li>
	<li>Launch: both company and product</li>
	<li>Demand creation (advertising, public relations, trade shows, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p class="ind">Some of these building blocks, such as company launch, are one-time events. Others happen infrequently (company and product positioning), and still others occur continually (demand-creation activities). Still, every company that launches a new product—whether the company is a startup or a venerable firm with a 100-year track record—must organize and execute with these four building blocks. Most startups execute these building blocks haphazardly and without thought of how they interconnect to build the company.</p>
<p class="ind">One of PhotosToYou’s problems in setting out its marketing priorities was a lack of clarity in terminology. The company used the word “branding” in lieu of a more precise description of the three types of Customer Creation activities.</p>
<h3 class="left20">Customer Creation Timing</h3>
<p class="noind">Although Customer Creation as a set of specific activities is one step in the Customer Development model, implicit in the entire model is the idea that Customer Creation does not happen in one day, one week, or even one month. Rather, it is a continuous, ongoing process that starts the day the company is founded. The whole premise of this book is that a startup needs to learn and discover as early as possible. That having been said, one of the most egregious mistakes a startup can make is beginning some of the expensive Customer Creation activities (advertising, heavy PR, etc.) too early. A key tenet of the Customer Development philosophy is there should be no serious spending in marketing until the company has a proven and repeatable sales roadmap. It’s in this sense that Customer Creation is a discrete step that follows Customer Discovery and Customer Validation.</p>
<p class="ind">As shown in <a href="#table5_4">Table 5.4</a>, however, all four building blocks of Customer Creation require intensive preparation in the prior Customer Discovery and Customer Validation steps.</p>
<p class="ind">If you have followed the Customer Development process up to now, you are well prepared for Customer Creation. And as you notice, one of the persistent themes from the earliest stages of Customer Development was asking, “What Market Type is our company in?”</p>
<p class="ind" id="page169">In Customer Discovery, the company articulates the customer problem and product concept, and tests it with potential customers. During this process the company gains an understanding of how customers perceive other vendors who can solve the same problem. As it continues to talk to customers the company starts asking, “What type of startup are we?” As it understands how customers work it also acquires information about how customers buy, what they read, what trade shows they attend, and so on. The founders attend trade shows and conferences, listening to the presentations, watching demos, and noting the positioning of the others in their space. The company begins to develop lists of key press contacts, analysts, and influencers. By this point the Customer Development team should be able to describe how customers do their jobs without, and then with, the company’s new product or service. If the team can do this, they’re in shape to launch the product. If they can’t, then the company’s ability to create meaningful positioning that connects with customers is suspect.</p>
<p class="ind">When the company moves to Customer Validation, the level of information gathering intensifies. By now the company has built a first pass of a sales roadmap and has an understanding of the early customer path to purchase. The company tests its initial company and product positioning with earlyvangelists and other early customers by using it to sell.</p>
<p class="ind">Finally in Customer Creation, the company finalizes its positioning and launches the company and product. All the standard marketing communications activities begin to ramp up. However, the next surprise about this step is that the type of launch is dependent upon the type of startup. There is no “one-size fits all” company or product launch.</p>
<div class="figure">
	<p class="center" id="page170"><a id="table5_4"/><img alt="" src="images/table_5_4.jpg"/></p>
	<p class="caption"><i><b>Four Building Blocks of Customer Creation</b> (Table 5.4)</i></p>
</div>
<h3 class="left20">Customer Creation and the Customer Development Team</h3>
<p class="noind">One last point about Customer Creation: Most startups know only too well the frustration of finally bringing an innovative new product to market and then getting disappointing early sales. Not only frustrating, it’s usually the beginning of internecine warfare between Sales and Marketing as they engage in a rising chorus of finger-pointing exercises. Marketing accuses Sales of poor salesmanship. Sales counters with claims of poor positioning, inadequate pricing models, or inaccurate<a id="page171"/> market analysis. Engineering believes both groups are made up of bozos who don’t understand the product’s technical attributes and benefits.</p>
<p class="ind">One key insight of the Customer Creation strategy is that there is no “pass the buck” hand-off of a product from Engineering to Marketing, and then to Sales. The entire Customer Development model is predicated on the notion of a Customer Development team that understands the customer’s problem, validates a sales roadmap, and works together to select, then execute the correct Customer Creation strategy. This is the antithesis of departmental-level buck passing.</p>
<p class="ind">Also note the absence of a marketing communications department at this phase of a startup’s life. In fact, there is no marketing department, or sales department. And therefore there is no marketing budget, or sales budget. There is only a <a href="http://steveblank.com/2013/07/29/building-great-founding-teams/">Customer Development team</a> and budget. Sure, there are people who write the marketing literature and others who specialize in closing a sale, but they are all working for Customer Development. Only after the company has identified its customers; validated the sales roadmap; and entered, created, or resegmented the market will the organizations within the company begin to differentiate into their traditional roles in Step 4, Company Building.</p>
<h3 class="center20">Overview of the Customer Creation Process</h3>
<p class="noind20">Customer Creation has four phases, as shown in <a href="#figure5_1">Figure 5.1</a>. Phase 1 begins with a series of “getting ready to launch” activities: choosing a Market Type (and therefore the type of Customer Creation strategy) and setting year one Customer Creation and sales goals. As part of this process the company makes a serious effort to understand market size, total available market, and available customer budgets. Finally, the company writes down its strategy, goals, objectives, and milestones, and puts together the Customer Creation budget.</p>

	<p class="caption"><i><b>Customer Creation: Overview of the Process</b> (Figure 5.1)</i></p>
</div>
<p class="ind">Next, in Phase 2 the company develops the company and product positioning messages. In Phase 3 the company launches its product; defines the audience, messengers, and messages; and establishes metrics for gauging success. Finally, in Phase 4 the company matches demand-creation activities (advertising, adwords, public relations, trade shows, etc.) to the sales roadmap.</p>
<p class="ind">Note this step does not cover traditional marketing communications demand-creation tactics such as adwords, advertising and <a href="http://steveblank.com/2009/07/13/rocket-science-4-the-press-is-our-product/">public relations</a>. Rather, it covers new ideas for Customer Creation strategy. With that understanding, let’s look at each phase in detail.</p>
<h3 class="center20" id="page173">Phase 1: Get Ready to Launch</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub12_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">This phase of Customer Creation sets the “big-picture” strategy for all the company’s Customer Creation activities. Historically, marketing communication in startups has acted as an “execution” function. While a startup will need execution later, Customer Creation strategy should come first. In this phase you do the following:</p>
<ul class="disc">
	<li>Construct a Market-Type questionnaire</li>
	<li>Choose the Market Type</li>
	<li>Agree on the company’s first-year customer creation and sales objectives</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="left20">A. Get Ready to Launch: Construct a Market-Type Customer Questionnaire</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub12_2.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">Now that you have collected qualitative and quantitative data about customers and your market, you are ready to choose your Market Type. In gathering this data you have an enviable advantage you did not have before: your early customers. Unlike startups that are trying to figure their Market Type before they have talked to customers, you have had months, if not years, in front of customers in the Customer Discovery and Validation steps. In fact, you have passionate earlyvangelists as customers who typically have opinions about everything. In addition, you’ve spoken to hundreds of suspects and prospects. Why not start by asking your existing customers and prospects what they think?</p>
<p class="ind">Do this by first assembling a Market-Type Questionnaire. An example is shown in <a href="#figure5_2">Figure 5.2</a> (in this example, the startup is marketing to businesses). In an actual questionnaire, substitute your company name where “the startup” appears.</p>
<div class="figure">
	<p class="center" id="page174"><a id="figure5_2"/><img alt="" src="images/fig_5_2.jpg"/></p>
	<p class="caption"><i><b>Example of a Customer Market-Type Questionnaire</b> (Figure 5.2)</i></p>
</div>
<h3 class="left20" id="page175">B. Get Ready to Launch: Choose the Market Type</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub12_3.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">Understanding your Market Type can help your company avoid the sort of expensive errors PhotosToYou encountered. If PhotosToYou had understood it was in a new market, it would have known no amount of spending to develop branding would create enough customers. Equally important, it would have known its revenue projections were unrealistic. (The effect of Market Type on sales revenue will be discussed in Step 4, Company Building.)</p>
<p class="ind">With the results from the Market-Type Questionnaire, combined with the Market Type analysis outlined in <a href="#figure5_2">Figure 5.2</a>, you now have sufficient information to pick your Market Type. Picking Market Type is more than just semantics. As we saw earlier in this chapter, all Customer Creation activities need to match the Market Type and startup. Assessing the risks and tradeoffs between each Market Type is first a matter of data collection, then a matter of data analysis, but in the end it is one of judgment. In some startups the choice between positioning as a company resegmenting an existing market or as entering an existing market is a matter of risk, reward, and instinct.</p>
<p class="ind">In Customer Discovery, Phase 1, I noted that for each type of startup there are <a href="http://startupweekend.wistia.com/medias/uw3wousqww">four variables</a>: knowledge of the customers, knowledge of the market, how important the product features are at first to the market, and the depth and breadth of competition. Now as part of your final selection of what type of company you are, add “risk” as one more item to think about, as shown in <a href="#table5_5">Table 5.5</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
	<p class="center"><a id="table5_5"/><img alt="" src="images/table_5_5.jpg"/></p>
	<p class="caption"><i><b>Types of Positioning, with Risk Added</b> (Table 5.5)</i></p>
</div>
<p class="ind" id="page176">The major risk in entering an existing market is the dominance of the competitors and the consequent cost of entry. Startups should not underestimate the cost of sales and marketing in taking on entrenched competitors. Even the world’s best products need distribution channels and heavy demand-creation spending to become known by potential purchasers. Since sales/distribution channels are “owned” by the incumbents, the cost of establishing your own or a parallel channel is another risk. Remember the rule of thumb: Attacking a competitor with a monopoly in an existing market requires three times the competitor’s spending. Attacking a market with multiple competitors requires 1.7 times the spending of the weakest player. For a startup these can be huge sums.</p>
<p class="ind">In addition, in an existing market the incumbents have set measures of performance. A startup can attempt to respond by picking the bases of competition (features, price, performance, etc.). Typically these are product features, so the ability of the new company to provide differentiated products is critical. For example, Transmeta, a new microprocessor company, attempted to challenge Intel head-on with an Intel-compatible chip that consumed drastically lower power. They had hoped better performance would allow them to target markets (i.e., hand-held devices) existing Intel chips could not satisfy. Unfortunately, the early Transmeta chips did not live up to the hype. Hence one risk of success in entering an existing market is predicated on Product Development.</p>
<p class="ind">The risks in a new market are different. You must define the new market in a way that aligns with users’ perceptions of their problem and your solution. Just as important for management and investors, a new market is a long-term investment. New market creation is not about quick returns and instant gratification. For example, Tivo positioned its Digital Video Recorder (DVR) as a new market category. Instead of comparing themselves to a VCR, they decided to create a new category, the DVR, where their products could be priced and differentiated from commodity VCRs. This new market creation takes deep pockets and a long-term vision.</p>
<p class="ind">The risks in resegmenting an existing market are a combination of those associated with creating a new market and entering an existing one. The segmentation of the existing market has to be spot-on, and the company must convince existing users their current vendors’ products don’t solve their problems. In addition, the product has to be different enough so existing customers of competitive products<a id="page177"/> can clearly see its unique attributes and benefits. Ikea is a great example of a resegmentation strategy that was both low-cost and targeted a niche. They offer low-cost furniture to customers who want a sense of style. Ikea lowers its costs by eliminating in-store assistance, having a limited variety of furniture (four styles), no delivery, and low-end quality. On the other hand, they delight low-cost buyers with on-site daycare, a great café, innovative housewares and toys, and airy and ultra-modern stores.</p>
<h4 class="left20">A Note on “First Mover Advantage”</h4>
<p class="noind"><a id="ft4"/>This is probably as good a place as any to talk about the fallacy of <a href="https://gsbapps.stanford.edu/researchpapers/library/rp969.pdf">“first mover advantage,”</a> which was first popularized in a 1988 paper by Stanford Business School professor David Montgomery and his co-author, Marvin Lieberman.<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup> This phrase was the theoretical underpinning of the out-of-control spending by startups during the dot-com bubble. Some Silicon Valley VCs used it to justify the wanton and reckless “get big fast” strategies of the era. Over time it gained mythical status until the idea that market-share leaders have been the first (not just early) entrants into their categories became unchallenged conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley. The only problem? It’s simply not true. The irony is that in a retrospective paper 10 years later (1998), the authors backed off from their claims. By then it was too late.</p>
<p class="ind"><a id="ft5"/>In fact, a <a href="http://steveblank.com/2010/10/04/why-pioneers-are-the-ones-with-the-arrows-in-their-backs/">1993 paper by Peter N. Golder and Gerard J. Tellis</a> had a much more accurate description of what happens to startup companies entering new markets.<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> In their analysis Golder and Tellis found almost half of the market pioneers in their sample of 500 brands in 50 product categories failed. Even worse, the survivors’ mean market share was lower than that found in other studies. Further, their study shows early market leaders (as distinct from first entrants) have much greater long-term success; those in their sample entered the market an average of 13 years later than the pioneers. What’s directly relevant from their work is a hierarchy showing what being first actually means for startups entering new markets:</p>
<table class="table">
<tr>
	<td class="td"><p class="lnoind">• Innovator</p></td>
	<td class="td"><p class="lnoind">First to develop or patent an idea</p></td>
	<td class="td"> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td class="td"><p class="lnoind">• Product Pioneer</p></td>
	<td class="td"><p class="lnoind">First to have a working model</p></td>
	<td class="td"> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td class="td"><p class="lnoind">• Market Pioneer</p></td>
	<td class="td"><p class="lnoind">First to sell the product</p></td>
	<td class="td"><p class="lnoind">47% failure rate</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td class="td"><p class="lnoind">• Early market leader</p></td>
	<td class="td"><p class="lnoind">Entered early but not first</p></td>
	<td class="td"><p class="lnoind">8% failure rate</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="ind" id="page178">First mover advantage (in the sense of trying to be the first one on a shelf or with a press release) is not real, and the race to be the first company into a new market can be destructive. Therefore, startups whose mantra is “we have to be first to market” usually lose. There are very few cases where a second, third, or even 10th entrant cannot become a profitable or even dominant player. For example, Ford was the first successfully mass-produced car in the United States. In 1921, Ford sold 900,000 Model Ts for 60 percent market share compared to General Motors’ 61,000 Chevys, a 6 percent market share. Over the next 10 years, while Ford focused on cost reductions, General Motors built a diverse and differentiated product line. By 1931 GM had 31% of the market to Ford’s 28%, a lead it has never relinquished. Just to make the point that markets are never static, Toyota, a company that sold its first car designed for the U.S. market in 1964, is poised to become the dominant American car company. The issue is not being first to market, but understanding the type of market your company is going to enter.</p>
<h3 class="left20">C. Get Ready to Launch: First-Year Customer Creation and Sales Objectives</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub12_4.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">Once Market Type is selected, the year-one revenue, spending, and market-share objectives for both Customer Creation and sales can be set. While this book can’t do justice to the complex interplay among initial sales forecasts, sales budgets, spending for customer awareness, demand creation, and customer acquisition, they are all intimately linked as part of a Customer Creation strategy. This section attempts to simplify this ball of twine by noting there are radically different first-year goals depending on Market Type.</p>
<h4 class="left20">For an Existing Market</h4>
<p class="noind">If entering an existing market, the year-one objective is to take as much market share as possible from incumbents. Consequently, all Customer Creation activities must single-mindedly focus on demand creation and customer acquisition. To determine how big the opportunity is, use market research data to estimate the size of the total available market. However, a more meaningful number for planning is the size of the serviceable available market. This subset of the total available market is the target market for first-year sales. To calculate the serviceable available market, subtract all the customers who are unreachable<a id="page179"/> in the first year. They may be unreachable because they have already bought a competitive product, because they have product needs broader than your startup’s initial offerings, or because they need a “whole product” (your product plus service, support, and other infrastructure only a mature company can deliver).</p>
<p class="ind">Next, put together a sales forecast. Since you’ve been out selling to earlyvangelists, this should be more than a guess. By now you have a pretty good feel for who to sell to, how long the sales cycle is, and what your pricing should be. Start with an exercise that says, “If we had no competition and the product were free, how many customers could we get in year one?” Follow that with, “OK, the product is still free, but now we have competitors. How many customers would use our product in year one?” You’d be surprised how many times an answer greater than the total number of available customers comes back from overenthusiastic salespeople. Keep refining the questions: “Given our actual pricing, how many customers could afford our product in year one?” “Given how fast we could hire and train salespeople (or bring on a distribution channel), how many could we sell?” Then take these numbers and compare them to the industry norm of dollars per salesperson or per channel. Since you are in an existing market, these numbers exist, some published, some not. Take all of this to derive the upper bound of potential first-year revenue. Very few startups ever exceed their first-year forecast.</p>
<p class="ind">Using this revenue number, calculate the number of customers your sales organization will need in order to achieve the first-year revenue goal. From there, start working the sales forecast model backwards. How many qualified prospects will you need to close an order? How many raw leads will that number require? If Sales had everything it wanted, where would the most qualified leads come from? For example, for a Web-based product, this exercise should result in understanding how to optimize a search engine strategy and Google ads to drive customers to your site. For a direct-sales organization this should result in understanding how many leads the traditional demand creation activities need to pour into the sales pipeline for sales to make its first-year revenue plan. With that number as a goal you can start thinking about how much to spend on customer acquisition activities.</p>
<p class="ind">The first year of a startup includes one-time costs not found in an existing company: product and company launch, as well as distribution channel one-time costs (headcount, training, channel stocking costs, etc.). Add these one-time costs to the ongoing demand-creation and customer acquisition costs to come up with the Customer Creation budget for year one. More often than not, a first pass through these numbers exceeds the gross national product of small countries. It usually takes several iterations to get numbers<a id="page180"/> a startup can afford. As you redo the budget, it’s easy to forget the goal. Remember, the objective is market share, which in an existing market is achieved by product differentiation. The Customer Creation goal is to create and drive end-user demand into the sales channel.</p>
<p class="ind">Finally, test your budget number against the New Lanchester Strategy: If a single company has a monopoly on the market, your first-year spending should be three times your competitor’s sales and marketing budget. If there are multiple competitors in the market, then you can enter with 1.7 times the sales and marketing budget of the smallest player.</p>
<h4 class="left20">For a New Market</h4>
<p class="noind">If entering a new market, the year-one objective has nothing to do with market share. This idea alone is worth the price of this book. There is no way a new company can get meaningful orders from a market that doesn’t exist. Therefore, spending money on a massive launch to garner customers and market share is ludicrous.</p>
<p class="ind">PhotosToYou is a good example of how smart startups fall into this trap because they believe the hyperbole of first mover advantage. The momentum of the marketing communications execution team inexorably pushes a startup down a spending path from which there is often no recovery. A Customer Creation strategy can eliminate these types of errors.</p>
<p class="ind">The year-one objective for a company in a new market is to drive or grow adoption of this market. The limited demand-creation activities the company engages in are focused on (1) customer education about the new market and (2) turning earlyvangelists into “reference customers” for the emerging market to emulate. The success criterion for year one is that the number of potential customers has gone from zero to meaningful.</p>
<h4 class="left20">For Resegmenting a Market</h4>
<p class="noind">If resegmenting an existing market, the year-one objective is doubly difficult. Not only do you have to garner as much market share as possible, but you must educate customers about the new issues in the market. The Customer Creation activities must create demand and acquire customers while segmenting the market in a way that is meaningful to customers.</p>
<p class="ind">In entering a market you are resegmenting, the budget process is the same as for entering an existing market. As in an existing market, test your budget number against<a id="page181"/> the New Lanchester Strategy; while the rules are the same, if you’ve segmented the market correctly, the number of your competitors should be significantly reduced.</p>
<h3 class="center20">Phase 2: Position the Company and Product</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub13_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">Phase 2 of Customer Creation aggregates all the company’s <a href="http://steveblank.com/2009/03/26/supermac-war-story-4-repositioning-supermac-market-type-at-work/">positioning</a> efforts to date. By this time you have a lot of data to help develop effective positioning. In Customer Discovery, you gained an understanding of customer perceptions of other competitors that might solve their problem. In Customer Validation, you acquired earlyvangelists as paying customers and heard their feedback on your proposed corporate and product positioning. You also articulated a value proposition for the product. Based on feedback from early customers, this value proposition became the initial positioning for the company and product. Now, in this phase, you will further refine the corporate and product positioning by gathering customer, press, and analyst feedback.</p>
<p class="ind">Remember, the goal of positioning is to control the public’s perception of a product or service as it relates to competitors’ alternatives. The company and product positioning you develop in this phase becomes the touchstone for communications, marketing, and relationships. All company and product messages are derived from this positioning.</p>
<p class="ind">In this phase you should:</p>
<ul class="disc">
	<li>Select a public relations agency</li>
	<li>Conduct internal and external positioning audits</li>
	<li>Match positioning to Market Type</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="left20">A. Position the Company and Product: Select a Public Relations Agency</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub13_2.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">Because Customer Creation begins with thinking and planning (strategy) rather than just spending money on marketing communications (execution), the company may<a id="page182"/> need to bring in specialized help. What the company needs at this stage is help in strategic communications. This expertise is typically found in some public relations agencies. Good PR agencies are adroit at helping a company (1) position itself and its products, (2) articulate its message and refine its audience, and (3) get industry influencers and messengers to communicate the company’s message.</p>
<p class="ind">Hiring an agency does not mean the Customer Development team abdicates its role in the process. Your company is not along for the ride. It’s your responsibility to set your organization’s goals and to understand the wants and needs of your target customers. The agency’s job is to understand what the company’s goal is, provide additional customer insights from their other projects, and develop positioning and craft messages that effectively communicate how your product uniquely meets customer needs.</p>
<p class="ind">In hiring an agency for the Customer Creation step, make sure you are evaluating the agency’s ability to think about positioning and communication strategy, not just its skill with “how to get press” tactics. Are they knowledgeable about your market or adjacent markets? Do they have any customer-specific knowledge? That is, does their research extend past the press to actual target customers? Are they creative? Will they come up with better insights than your own team? Is strategy a core strength of their agency? Have they shown you examples that made you smarter? Do they have metrics in place to measure success for each client? Does talk of measurement make them nervous? Once you’ve satisfied yourself with the answers to these questions, get a written agreement that the individuals who impressed and convinced you their firm could do the job will actually spend time on your account.</p>
<p class="ind">Finally, make sure your agency understands and buys into the notion of Market Type. If the people at the agency resolutely believe that all startups are launched the same way, hiring them will be an expensive mistake. The good news is that most sophisticated agencies know there are different Market Types—they just have never used the terminology before.</p>
<h3 class="left20" id="page183">B. Position the Company and Product: Conduct Internal and External Audits</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub13_3.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">Before the company spends a dime on positioning, it’s a good idea to air out the conference room and get some facts. The best way to do so is with a market tool called an audit. An audit is an unbiased way to learn how others perceive your company and products. In an external audit the PR firm calls customers and messengers (industry analysts and influencers, members of the press, and others we’ll define later in this chapter) and asks them a series of questions, similar to the kinds of questions you asked in your market-type about how they perceive your company. Think of the results as a baseline of the perceptions others have about your company.</p>
<div class="figure">
	<p class="center" id="page184"><a id="figure5_3"/><img alt="" src="images/questionnaire.jpg"/></p>
	<p class="caption"><i><b>Example of an External Audit Questionnaire</b> (Figure 5.3)</i></p>
</div>
<p class="ind" id="page185">Once you understand what others think (usually a surprise to most startups breathing the rarified air of their own conference rooms), the company can work to change and shape those opinions. An example of an external audit is shown in <a href="#figure5_3">Figure 5.3</a>.</p>
<p class="ind">While conducting an audit is the kind of activity PR agencies excel at, handing this function off completely is a serious mistake in a startup. Just as your early sales calls were too important to be handled by salespeople, your early audits are too important to be handed off to a PR agency. The founding team should make the first five or so calls.</p>
<p class="ind">Listening to external voices share their perceptions about the company is one half of this audit step. Listening inside the company is the other half. An internal audit directs the same questions to the founding team and executive staff. Most startups assume they have internal unanimity on all the issues in the external audit. An internal audit will probably reveal you have a cacophony of voices. The goal of the internal audit is to hear those differences and extract new ideas. When the company has agreed on a final positioning at the end of this phase, you then communicate those ideas back to the entire organization so it speaks with one voice.</p>
<h3 class="left20">C. Position the Company and Product: Match Positioning to Market Type</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub13_4.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">Company positioning answers, “What does your company do for me?” A great company positioning begins and ends with the customer in mind. If potential customers heard your company positioning statement, would they care? Would they get excited and want to feel connected with the company? For example Apple Computer positions itself as a manufacturer of “cool computers,” appealing to trend-setting customers. The positioning leaves you with a sense of whether you want to investigate the company’s product offerings further by what you believe Apple stands for and excludes some people who are turned off by the positioning.</p>
<p class="ind">As suggested earlier, the messages the company wants to send about itself and its products differ by Market Type. So now it’s time to match the positioning to the Market Type you have selected. An experienced PR agency or consultant can help you brainstorm, but you must make the Market Type choice by the end of this phase.</p>
<h4 class="left20" id="page186">For an Existing Market</h4>
<p class="noind">If you are entering an existing market, then company positioning is about creating the notion that your company is both different and credible. When Handspring entered the personal digital assistant market, people understood that the company was a manufacturer of Palm-like devices but they were going to be expandable, faster, cheaper, and somehow better. Handspring also had immediate credibility since the founders were the creators of the Palm and the entire PDA market.</p>
<p class="ind">Once the positioning for the company is chosen, product positioning follows. Since in an existing market comparable products exist, product positioning typically describes how and why your product is different along an existing axis/basis of competition. Differentiation in an existing market can take one of three forms. You can describe differences in product attributes (faster, cheaper, less filling, 30% more), in distribution channel (pizza in 30 minutes, home delivery, see your nearest dealer, build it yourself on the Web), or in service (five-year, 50,000-mile warranty; 90-day money-back guarantee; lifetime warranty). For example, Handspring differentiated on product attributes. It said that all Handspring PDAs were different and better because they were “expandable with a Springboard expansion module, and had 16 versus 8 megabytes of memory.”</p>
<p class="ind">Because the market already existed, and customers understood the basis of competition, existing PDA customers understood what Handspring was talking about. The result was 30% of the Palm-compatible market in 15 months.</p>
<h4 class="left20">For a New Market</h4>
<p class="noind">If you are creating a new market, company positioning cannot be about how different your company is, since there are no other companies to compare it to. Positioning here is about communicating a vision and passion of what could be. It answers the questions, “What is wrong with the world that you want to make right? What is it that your company is trying to change?” When Palm created the first personal digital assistant, the company positioning was about communicating a vision of how having a PDA was going to make life easier for consumers. As another example, PhotosToYou’s passionate positioning should have been “allowing consumers to make hassle-free photo prints from your digital camera.” That was a vision a digital camera customer could understand and connect with. Instead, PhotosToYou described itself as “the best online photofinisher.” While technically correct, that message assumed potential customers understood what an online photofinisher was. When the market does not yet exist,<a id="page187"/> customers need to first understand what problem your company is solving.</p>
<p class="ind">After positioning the company, positioning the product in a new market becomes pretty simple. Touting a new product’s features is unproductive, since there is no context to understand the features—no comparable products exist. For example, if Palm had positioned its first PDA product as having 16 megabytes of memory and being expandable, no one would have had a clue what it was talking about. Instead Palm’s product positioning talked about the problem the product solved (“Now executives can keep in sync with their computers”) and how the product solved it (“A PDA allows you to put all those functions in your pocket”).</p>
<h4 class="left20">For Resegmenting a Market</h4>
<p class="noind">If you are resegmenting an existing market, then company positioning depends on segmentation of the market, not differentiation. Segmentation means you’ve picked a clear and distinct spot in customers’ minds that is unique, understandable, and, most importantly, concerns something they value, and want and need now. Company positioning for this Market Type communicates the value of the market segment you’ve chosen and the innovation your company brings to it.</p>
<p class="ind">There are two types of market resegmentation: as a segmented niche or as a low-cost provider. Jet Blue is an example of low-cost resegmentation. Unlike Southwest Airlines, an example of low-cost resegmentation which offered cheap fares, matched by minimal frills, Jet Blue entered the airline business as a low-cost passenger airline that provides high-quality customer service on point-to-point routes. To contain costs, Jet Blue focused on underserved markets and large metropolitan areas that have high average fares.</p>
<p class="ind">The rise of Wal-Mart was an example of an entrepreneur recognizing an existing market was ripe for a niche resegmentation. In the 1960s and ’70s, Sears and Kmart dominated big box discount retailing, opening large stores where they thought there was sufficient population to sustain them. Smaller communities either got catalog stores (Sears) or were simply ignored (Kmart). Sam Walton realized towns being dismissed as “too small” were an opportunity for a large discount retailer. “Small towns first” was the unique niche resegmentation Wal-Mart initially took. Once established, it proudly positioned itself as a “discounter”—a sobriquet the large retailers avoided like the plague. Wal-Mart sold name-brand health and beauty aids at cost. This strategy, supported by heavy advertising, pulled in customers who then purchased other products that,<a id="page188"/> while priced low, carried high gross margins. Equally important, Wal-Mart’s adoption of cutting-edge technology to track how people shop, and to buy and deliver goods more efficiently and cheaply than any rival, allowed it to reduce its cost of sales to a fraction of its competitors’. By 2002 Kmart was bankrupt and Wal-Mart was the largest company in the world.</p>
<p class="ind">When resegmenting a market, product positioning is a hybrid of positioning for a new market and positioning for an existing one. Since your segmentation has moved your product into a space adjacent to your competitors, product positioning describes how and why your new market segment is different and important to your customers.</p>
<h3 class="center20">Phase 3: Launch the Company and Product</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub14_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">Once the heavy lifting of positioning is complete, the company is ready to get to the tactics of launch. The launch phase of Customer Creation is the culmination of all your strategy efforts. A company launch is when your company communicates to an audience for the first time what it is, what it stands for, and what it’s selling. A product launch describes why customers should want to buy your specific product. In a startup, these two launches often occur simultaneously. The process for launching is similar. You prepare communications materials, pick the audience you want to reach, craft the message, choose the messengers and context, and get ready to create demand. Then you check yourself by measuring how well you did so course correction can take place. Step-by-step you do the following:</p>
<ul class="disc">
	<li>Select a launch by Market Type</li>
	<li>Select the customer audiences</li>
	<li>Select the messengers</li>
	<li>Craft the messages</li>
	<li>Understand the message context</li>
	<li>Understand the media for the message</li>
	<li>Measure success</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="left20" id="page189">A. Launch: Select a Launch by Market Type</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub14_2.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">Launching a company or a product is akin to launching an ICBM: what you hurl into the stratosphere is impossible to call back, and its impact can have immense consequences. Much like an ICBM launch, company launches should never be accidental, and they should require much forethought. The company needs to select and commit to a launch strategy matching its Market Type.</p>
<p class="ind">In the last phase you’ve said your company falls into one of the three Market Types. Now it is time to select the type of company and product launch to match that Market Type. There are three types of launches: onslaught, niche, and early adopter. Let’s look at what is unique about each type.</p>
<h4 class="left20">For an Existing Market: Onslaught Launch</h4>
<p class="noind">An onslaught launch is a full-frontal assault on a market using every available demand-creation tool. Most startups select this launch approach. However, it is the correct launch model for only one type of strategy: capturing market share in an existing market. Onslaught is an expensive, high-commitment move characterized by maximum exposure at a single point in time. This type of launch is heavily weighted to up-front expenditures on advertising, public relations, trade shows, direct mail, and so on.</p>
<p class="ind"><a href="http://iwspm2008.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/tfehlmann-lanchestertheory.pdf">The New Lanchester</a> Strategy rules to determine the cost of market entry apply to this type of launch, but ironically, the bigger and more diverse your competitor, the better your odds. Why? Because in facing a diversified company, you are not facing the full brunt of your competitor’s sales and marketing might. Its spending is spread over multiple divisions, multiple products, and multiple distribution channels. For example, suppose you decided to enter the computer mouse business. Microsoft is the dominant player, and according to our rules, you would need at least 1.7 times Microsoft’s sales and marketing budget to enter this market (refer to <a href="#table5_2">Table 5.2</a>). How on earth could you ever get that? At first glance, this looks hopeless. But on closer inspection, it may be doable. Competing with a company with multiple divisions and product lines means you can focus all your resources (read: every dollar you have) to<a id="page190"/> compete with the division or product line that directly opposes your product, not the entire company. Therefore, again using Microsoft as the example, your cost of entering this market is now 1.7 times the spending of the Microsoft peripheral division. While still a formidable number (and perhaps still enough to scare you away), it allows you to calculate the true cost of entry.</p>
<p class="ind">Obviously we’re only talking about market entry, not long-term competition. Kick a large company in the shins long and hard enough, and you will get its attention. (Ask Netscape what happened when it belittled Microsoft one too many times in the business press. Sometimes big, sleeping giants can awaken.) By the time your competitor turns its full marketing and sales prowess on to your company, you’d better have turned your early market advantage into defensible market share by using the chasm-crossing strategies in the Company Building step.</p>
<h4 class="left20">For a New Market: Early Adopter Launch</h4>
<p class="noind"><a id="ft6"/>In contrast to onslaught and niche launches, the early adopter launch is a targeted, low-cost approach. The goal here is to prepare a new market for the day it will become a mass market. Since the target market does not support enough customers to justify spending to gain market share, the aim is to gain maximum mind share. The good news is by their very nature, early adopters tend to ignore expensive mass-market advertising and PR events. Instead, they rely on other media such as the Internet, focus groups, and word of mouth. An early adopter launch is the beginning of a long, drawn-out education campaign initially targeted to earlyvangelists. It uses the passion and enthusiasm of these earlyvangelists to diffuse a new idea into the collective consciousness of potential customers and thereby to create a market. Put another way, the goal is to create a “tipping point” in customer demand. (The best description of these “tipping point” strategies is in <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/">Malcolm Gladwell’s</a> book, <i>The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference.</i><sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup>) This is the antithesis of the onslaught launch. New markets are not created overnight; it can take three to seven years from product launch for a new market to reach sufficient size for most startups to become profitable.</p>
<p class="ind">During the dot-com bubble, venture capitalists and PR agencies advocated the onslaught launch for companies entering new markets. They preached startups were all about first-mover advantage. An onslaught launch would persuade competitors to withdraw, or allow the startup to consolidate a fragmented industry, or at least<a id="page191"/> deter competitors from expanding their presence. The reality was much different. At PhotosToYou, for example, a cascading series of wrong assumptions had the company executing an onslaught launch for a new market. As they discovered, an onslaught launch in a new market with few customers is a huge expenditure of money with very little return. PhotosToYou survived, but most startups in new markets that used an onslaught launch are out of business.</p>
<h4 class="left20">For Resegmenting a Market: Niche Launch</h4>
<p class="noind">If you are trying to resegment an existing market, the launch choices are a lot harder. New Lanchester Strategy rules still apply, but by segmenting the market, you’ve diluted the power of your competitors’ sales and marketing budgets since you are now in an adjacent market. The relevant question is: “Are there customers ready to buy in the segment we’ve defined?” If so, proceed with an all-out launch to capture market share (as in an onslaught launch), but target the launch to the customers in your new niche. In a niche launch, the company puts all its demand-creation dollars into acquiring a single identifiable market segment and customer. However, if the new segment you are defining is speculative—that is, you are creating the market segment and its customers—then treat this market as you would a new market and execute an early adopter launch.</p>
<h3 class="left20">B. Launch: Select the Customer Audiences</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub14_3.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">Having chosen your launch strategy, you next select the customer audiences—that is, who your launch messages are intended to reach. This is the first step in creating demand for the product. Later, in the Company Building step, when your company starts broad-based demand-creation spending on advertising, trade shows, etc., the audience may broaden, but for now, you want to know who will be the first recipients of the messages.</p>
<p class="ind">One pitfall startups often fall into is selecting an audience with whom they are comfortable and familiar, rather than the one most likely to buy their product. The Customer Development process should help you avoid looking in the wrong place for<a id="page192"/> your audience. In the past, startups would launch products before they had talked to customers, and so would have little knowledge of customers’ needs and desires. In contrast, if you have followed the Customer Development process you have already sold to earlyvangelist customers. By the time you get to company and product launch, you have gained extensive knowledge about the problems customers want solved. Moreover, in Customer Validation, you spent an inordinate amount of time not only understanding your customers’ needs, but learning exactly who buys and assembling an influence map of everyone involved in the buying process.</p>
<p class="ind">In addition, you have made enough actual sales to perceive whether your customers display any strong demographic or geographic purchase patterns. For example, you may have found that the majority of your earlyvangelist customers were under age 35 (demographic) or that customers on the West Coast purchased more frequently than those on the East Coast (geographic).</p>
<p class="ind">To define the audience for the launch, select the people on the influence map your launch messages need to reach. However, beware of another trap startups fall into: thinking everyone on the influence map is a target for the launch messages. Everyone can’t be in the audience, or the message will get diluted. To be successful the audience must be a small group (or even an individual) that carries the most influence. More specifically:</p>
<ul class="disc">
	<li>In an existing market the launch audience is the user or organization responsible for choosing (not necessarily using) the product</li>
	<li>In a new market, the launch audience consists of potential earlyvangelists who recognize they have a problem and have been actively looking for a solution</li>
	<li>In a resegmented market, the launch audience is made up of users or organizations that will appreciate the segment you’ve selected</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="left20">C. Launch: Select the Messengers</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub14_4.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">Now that you have an idea of who your launch audience is, think about one other group that will receive the launch messages. As shown in <a href="#figure5_4">Figure 5.4</a>, at launch the company must educate not just its customer audience, but its messengers — the people or organizations that will convey the message to that audience.</p>
<div class="figure">
	<p class="center" id="page193"><a id="figure5_4"/><img alt="" src="images/fig_5_4.jpg"/></p>
	<p class="caption"><i><b>Multiple Audiences: Your Target Audience Is Reached Via Messengers</b> (Figure 5.4)</i></p>
</div>
<p class="ind">PR people sometimes use the term “industry influencers.” However, in <i>The Tipping Point,</i> Malcolm Gladwell articulates a theory that there are certain personality types who can create change by word-of-mouth, which he calls the “law of the few.” Captivate these critical people, he says, and your message becomes contagious. The example he uses are epidemics; dramatic changes build slowly to a critical mass and then explode overnight — seemingly in response to the smallest of changes.</p>
<p class="ind">One of Gladwell’s personality types includes “messengers.” His hypothesis, which is borne out by empirical evidence from new company and product launches, is this: To communicate a new idea or product you only need to reach a few well-placed and highly leveraged individuals called messengers. Messengers have a special gift for bringing the world together. Because of their influence and connections, this small group is single-handedly capable of igniting a revolution in the marketplace. As part of your launch, it’s critical to identify these people and communicate the company message and positioning to them.</p>
<p class="ind">There are three types of messengers your company needs to educate: Experts, evangelists, and connectors. Experts are exactly what they sound like. They know your industry or product in detail, and others rely on them for their opinions. Experts may be industry analysts in private research firms (Gartner, NPD, AMR), Wall Street analysts (Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs), or consultants who provide advice for your particular industry. Experts may even be potential customers who run user groups other potential customers turn to for advice.</p>
<p class="ind" id="page194">Some experts will not proselytize about any individual product and will charge for their generic advice and counsel. However, an important segment of experts talk about “best products.” These are the product reviewers in what are nominally paid media. Walt Mossberg, the technology columnist for <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i> David Pogue at <i>The New York Times,</i> and Stewart Alsop at Fortune are examples of experts who discuss and recommend products. Experts lay great store on their independence. During company and product launch, the press and early customers call on experts to help them obtain an independent view of your company’s claims. In Customer Discovery and Customer Validation, you identified the experts in your industry or segment and developed relationships with them. As a prerequisite to launch, you must know what they believe and educate them about your company and product.</p>
<p class="ind">The second classes of messengers, evangelists, are unabashed cheerleaders and salespeople for your product and, if yours is a new or resegmented market, for your Market Type. They tell everyone how great the product is and about the unlimited potential of your product and market. While nominally carrying less credibility than experts, evangelists have two advantages: typically they are paying customers, and they are incredibly enthusiastic about what they have to say. As you’ve seen in signing up early customers, earlyvangelists had to share in the company’s vision to take a risk to purchase before the product had even shipped. Emotionally they have as much on the line as you do. Most are more than willing to stand up and tell others why they bought.</p>
<p class="ind">At times startups confuse evangelists with customers who will give a reference. They are not the same. A customer reference is something you have to arm twist to get; an evangelist is someone you can’t get off the phone. By launch time, earlyvangelists need to be happy enough with your company and product to enthusiastically tell others about it.</p>
<p class="ind">Connectors are a sometimes unrecognized type of messenger. They are not product or industry experts, nor have they bought anything from your company. They are individuals who seem to know everyone; each industry has a few. They may be bloggers who expound on the general state of your industry and write magazine or newspaper columns. They may be individuals who organize and hold conferences where the key industry thought leaders gather. Often they are the thought leaders. The other interesting point about connectors is their ability to bridge multiple worlds. Your relationships with connectors should be the same as the ones you’ve developed with the experts. You need to have already established a relationship and at minimum educated them about your<a id="page195"/> company and product before you get to this phase. Hopefully by launch connectors find your company and product interesting enough to write about in their newsgroups or to want you to speak at their conferences.</p>
<p class="ind">Great public relations firms know how to influence the messengers. They may have their own language describing who the messengers are (e.g., “influencers”) and how they manage the “information chain,” but a competent PR firm can add tremendous value at this step.</p>
<h3 class="left20">D. Launch: Craft the Messages</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub14_5.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">The messages the company delivers at launch are the cumulative result of all the positioning work you’ve done to date. Here I want to add just one more thought as you craft the final messages: messages need to be memorable and “sticky.” Why? Because the more memorable or sticky a message, the greater its ability to create change. And in the case of a company and product launch, not only do we want people to change their buying behavior; we want them to change how they think.</p>
<p class="ind">Great PR people know that tinkering with how they present information can dramatically change its impact. My favorite example of how a slight change in a message could have prevented a PR debacle was when Silicon Valley ran into a tenacious bug that took over all of Santa Clara County. No, it wasn’t a software bug or a glitch in Microsoft Windows. It was the Mediterranean fruit fly, a huge threat to California agriculture, the largest business in the state. In 1981 it had infested the home of high tech. The state decided the most expeditious way to eradicate this pest would be to use helicopters to spray a pesticide. Unfortunately, chemicals designed for total death to insects do not have consumer-friendly names. Rather than realize this, the state announced it was going to saturate the area with “Malathion,” a pesticide that would wipe out the Medfly. This decision was a political hairball for the governor, as California produces 25% of the country’s agricultural goods, and the spread of this Medfly would have a devastating impact on crops. Moreover, the notion of something called “Malathion— which resonated with fear and death—raining from the skies over their homes and children did not exactly bring screams of joy from the residents. People were outraged this toxic chemical was going to be sprayed on them.</p>
<p class="ind" id="page196">Now imagine that someone in the governor’s office had given the choice of the “message” two minutes of thought. A subtle change in the presentation of the message could have reduced the outcry and fear dramatically. Envisage the state had announced it was spraying “Spring Mist” or “Summer Dew,” or even “Bugs Away,” every evening rather than “Malathion.” The subtle alteration in the message would have had a dramatic impact. People would have been standing outside soaking up the spray rather than sealing their windows with plastic. You may laugh, thinking no one would change his or her perceptions based on semantics, but in fact people do every day. Think about a hamburger. You may eat a lot of them, but if McDonald’s message was “dead cow, slaughtered by the millions, butchered by minimum wage-earners, sometimes contaminated with E. coli, then ground into patties, frozen into solid blocks, and reheated when you order them,” instead of “You deserve a break today,” sales might be a tad lower.</p>
<p class="ind">For companies entering a new market, it’s almost a Silicon Valley axiom to give a new market its own TLA (three-letter acronym) or memorable phrase. The message it delivers is that the company is inventing something significant enough to have its own name. In enterprise software Sales Automation, CRM, and ERP have entered the lexicon. In consumer products, phrases like PDA, e-commerce, fast food, and Home Theater have meaning where none existed before. If you doubt the power of a memorable phrase to shape a debate, think about the battle of carefully crafted messages on each side of the abortion debate. You’re not “anti-abortion,” you’re “pro-life”; you’re not “pro-abortion,” you’re “pro-choice.” Each of these messages powerfully influences perceptions. For a company entering an existing market or attempting to resegment one, the messages are about, “There’s got to be a better way, and our company has it.” The messages answer the questions you posed when you talked to earlyvangelists: “What pain does this alleviate? What value does it deliver? And why should I care?”</p>
<h3 class="left20">E. Launch: Understand the Message Context</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub14_6.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">A message that is brilliant today and gets customers begging to buy your product could have fallen flat two years ago and may be obsolete in three years. Why? Because “no message is an island.” In crafting your messages, remember that all messages operate in a context. (Another idea from <i>The Tipping Point.)</i></p>
<p class="ind" id="page197">They don’t just show up in a potential customer’s ear by themselves. Messages are accompanied by lots of other messages that can radically increase (or decrease) how memorable or sticky your message is. Satellite TV (DirecTV, EchoStar) messages caught on when cable companies’ service became abysmal and pricing went through the roof. U.S. corporations paid a lot more attention to the security of their infrastructure after 9/11. The huge Y2K concerns of December 2000 were moot on Jan. 2, 2001.</p>
<p class="ind">In all these cases the message didn’t change, the context around it did. Another example is the collapse of the dot-com and telecom bubbles at the start of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The same e-commerce or telecom messages presented at the height of the bubble could raise a company $50 million and gain it access to almost any corporate executive suite. Not only would new startups get access, but the recipients of those messages felt smart if they passed on the information to their associates. Today, those messages wouldn’t get a phone call returned, and people would feel embarrassed if they repeated them. The messages in this new context were not only ineffective, they were toxic to anyone who passed them on. Ponder this for a minute: it’s the same message, same company, but a new context. The checklist in <a href="#table5_6">Table 5.6</a> will help you adjust your message to the context.</p>
<div class="figure">
	<p class="center"><a id="table5_6"/><img alt="" src="images/table_5_6.jpg"/></p>
	<p class="caption"><i><b>Message Context Checklist</b> (Table 5.6)</i></p>
</div>
<h3 class="left20">F Launch: Understand the Media for the Message</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub15_4.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">Media are part of any launch strategy; in effect, they are another type of messenger (see <a href="#figure5_4">Figure 5.4</a>). Think of paid media as paid messengers. Purchased media is one traditional way a company can deliver its messages directly. Media can be magazines, the U.S. Postal Service, or email. The message format may be ads, direct mail, or trade<a id="page198"/> shows. While paid media are a key part of any marketing communications strategy, remember that customers tend to see messages from unpaid messengers as much more credible. In fact, for most startups in the business-to-business space the use of paid media is overkill at launch.</p>
<p class="ind">Your company needs to formulate a media strategy—a plan that describes what media will be used to reach your customers and, more importantly, which media won’t. Rather than picking the cheapest media on the basis of readership, remember your hard work in the Customer Discovery and Customer Validation steps has already told you a lot about what media your early customers rely on. If you forgot to ask them, now is a good time to go back and iterate. The checklist in <a href="#table5_7">Table 5.7</a> will help formulate your questions.</p>
<div class="figure">
	<p class="center"><a id="table5_7"/><img alt="" src="images/table_5_7.jpg"/></p>
	<p class="caption"><i><b>Media Checklist</b> (Table 5.7)</i></p>
</div>
<h3 class="left20">G. Launch: Measure Success</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub15_5.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">One of the words I’ve been hard-pressed to find in the lexicon of marketers is “measurement.” “Measurement” is the bane of most marketing communications executives because they think keeping score belongs in accounting. Startups have found it difficult to measure the results of marketing expenditures in large part because they have had no concrete objectives. In Customer Creation we started with a series of strategic objectives (get market share, educate customers about the new market, etc.) so it would be easier to furnish a set of measurable objectives. In this phase you want to answer the question, “How do you know whether you have succeeded?” To do that, you need to first answer another question, namely, “What are the specific success criteria?”</p>
<p class="ind">To establish criteria for a successful launch, the Customer Development team needs to agree on its goals. For an existing market the metrics are pretty clear—leads that<a id="page199"/> will ultimately result in market share. But what about when you are redefining a market or entering a new market? How do you measure how much you’ve affected target customers’ perceptions? You already have a baseline: the customer and external audits you ran before the launch. After the launch, call the people on both audit lists and ask them the same questions again. Compare the results to find out how effective you were in reaching and influencing customers and key messengers.</p>
<p class="ind">Now expand the notion of an audit to include the press coverage your launch received. Do a press audit to gauge the extent to which the messages you thought you were communicating were actually picked up and repeated by the press. Are they using your three-letter acronym or phrase to describe the market? Are they describing the issues as your company has positioned them? Finally, how deep and wide was the coverage? Did you get brief mentions in two obscure trade magazines or a substantial notice in <i>The Wall Street Journal?</i> (<a href="#table5_8">Table 5.8</a> summarizes the techniques you can use to measure the success of your launch activities.)</p>
<div class="figure">
	<p class="center"><a id="table5_8"/><img alt="" src="images/table_5_8.jpg"/></p>
	<p class="caption"><i><b>Techniques for Measuring the Success of a Launch</b> (Table 5.8)</i></p>
</div>
<h3 class="center20">Phase 4: Create Demand</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub16_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">Demand creation encompasses all the marketing activities that “Get” customers and drive customer awareness and desire for your products. They include public relations, advertising, trade shows, seminars, and collateral (brochures, data sheets). Demand creation, the last phase in the Customer Creation step, is typically the first phase most<a id="page200"/> marketing communications executives want to execute. However, the place for demand creation is at the end of a thoughtful process, not at the beginning. In this phase you:</p>
<ul class="disc">
	<li>Select a demand-creation strategy matching the company’s first-year objectives</li>
	<li>Agree on demand-creation measurements</li>
	<li>Iterate, return, or exit</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="left20">A. Create Demand: Select a Strategy Matching First-Year Objectives</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub16_2.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">At times marketing departments remind me of the adage, “When you’re up to your neck in alligators, it’s hard to remember the goal was to drain the swamp.” The <a href="http://steveblank.com/2011/08/05/bonfire-of-the-vanities/">primary mistake</a> most marketing groups make is having goals for demand creation that are not the same as the goal for sales—in other words, to help the company make its revenue projection. For example, if your sales goals are to capture 10% market share and $3M in sales revenue in year one, then your demand-creation goals are the same. Once that is understood, then what follows is a demand-creation strategy that lists the steps you will take and the activities you will deploy to accomplish that goal. Traditionally, marketing and its communications programs have lots of moving parts, and it’s easy to let the complexity confuse the reason why they really exist.</p>
<p class="ind">So as a reminder in the Customer Development model, once the sales and demand creation goals are in sync:</p>
<ul class="disc">
	<li>For companies entering an existing market, the function of demand creation is to create qualified end-user demand and drive it into the sales channel</li>
	<li>For companies resegmenting a market, the function of demand creation is to educate customers about the new benefits resegmenting the market has created and drive demand into the sales channel</li>
	<li>For companies entering a new market, the function of demand creation is to educate customers about the market and drive the early or niche adopters into the sales channel. (See <a href="#table5_9">Table 5.9</a>)</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
	<p class="center" id="page201"><a id="table5_9"/><img alt="" src="images/table_5_9.jpg"/></p>
	<p class="caption"><i><b>Selecting a Demand Creation Strategy</b> (Table 5.9)</i></p>
</div>
<p class="ind">When I ran Marketing, to ensure my team understood their role in demand creation, I used to have them chant, “Our job is to create end-user demand and drive it into our channel” as an opening to my staff meeting (we were in an existing market). I also kept reminding them that demand-creation activities (advertising, trade shows) were in addition to the ongoing PR activities with the messengers that started with the company and product launch.</p>
<h3 class="left20">B. Create Demand: Agree on Measurements</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub16_3.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">Demand-creation budgets are the largest component of an ongoing marketing department. While picking the right media, trade show, or direct mail piece is still sometimes as much an art as a science, a process needs to be in place to measure results and course correct if necessary. In my marketing departments, we accomplished this by admitting not every demand-creation activity would be successful. We took ownership when they failed, and we course corrected when necessary Mistakes were accepted as part of the normal learning process. However, covering them up or not having a method to measure and correct mistakes were grounds for termination.</p>
<p class="ind">The best way to keep demand-creation activities and sales in sync is to agree on a set of goals for each stage in the pipeline and measure them. (Remember, you created this sales roadmap in Customer Validation.) Looking at the sales roadmap in <a href="#figure5_5">Figure 5.5</a>, you could simply say, “We need to pour leads into the sales funnel so orders come out.” However, that would be an indiscriminate use of scarce dollars.</p>
<div class="figure">
	<p class="center" id="page202"><a id="figure5_5"/><img alt="" src="images/fig_5_5.jpg"/></p>
	<p class="caption"><i><b>Demand Creation’s Role in the Sales Roadmap</b> (Figure 5.5)</i></p>
</div>
<p class="ind">Let’s use as an example the startup in an existing market with a goal of capturing 10% market share and $3M in sales revenue in year one. If the average selling price of the product is $500, then Sales must sell 6,000 units to bring in $3M in the first year. Work backwards from the 6,000 units at the end of the roadmap and calculate how many active customers are needed in the front of the roadmap. How many qualified leads (i.e., a potential customer who has expressed interest in your product and meets your buying criteria) turn into active customers? How many raw leads (i.e., a potential customer who has expressed interest in your product but has not yet been tested to see if they are potential buyers) are needed to get those qualified leads? What is the cost of each lead? What is the cost of acquiring each customer? Once these metrics are in place, you can begin to measure how effective your demand-creation spending is in relationship to these metrics. Then you have a baseline for course correction.</p>
<p class="ind">While setting goals for leads seems like a measurable activity, understanding how your marketing communications activities affect perception seems more difficult. I’ve been amazed at how often I’ve heard, “It’s impossible to measure customer perception.” The reality is much different; you can even measure it at a trade show. I used to have my trade show manager ask people coming into our booth whether they had ever heard<a id="page203"/> of our company. He took their contact information at the show and followed up with a phone call or an email afterward.</p>
<p class="ind">Then he would ask again if they had ever heard of our company. Over 78% of the show attendees who had said they had never heard of us when they first walked into our booth could now correctly describe our company and what it did. That’s measuring awareness.</p>
<h3 class="left20">C. Iterate, Return, or Exit</h3>
<p class="center20"><img alt="" src="images/bub16_4.jpg"/></p>
<p class="noind20">With Customer Creation under way, you are almost at the beginning of the end. With the company and product launch you have gotten the rocket off the pad in a very public way. You have conducted external audits, positioned the company and product, developed a set of messages to communicate the positioning, and launched your company and product with a series of messengers to carry the story. Demand creation is driving end-user demand into the sales channel. Finally, you are using and refining the metrics you’ve created to measure the marketing dollars you are spending. As sales begin to scale, you are probably feeling the hard part of creating a startup may be over.</p>
<p class="ind">However, as exhausting as the Customer Creation process has been, you may need to iterate parts of it again. Has the positioning made sense to real live customers out in the field? Do the messengers buy the story? Has demand creation driven hordes of customers to the feet of your salespeople? If not, don’t despair. As you have seen, every step in Customer Development is a learning and discovery process. It may be that your failures in positioning and messaging will bring new understanding as you analyze what didn’t work. Recall that even subtle changes in messages can make enormous differences. (When it was first introduced, “Diet-Beer” was laughed off the marketplace shelves. It took nerve and panache to reintroduce it as “Lite-Beer” and create an enormously profitable market.) Take everything you learned in Phases 1 through 3, modify your positioning based on feedback, go back to Phase 1 and do it again.</p>
<p class="ind">However, in some cases there may be nothing wrong with your positioning, messages, or demand-creation activities. The problem may be in the Market Type. If you are getting creamed by competitors, or if you cannot generate demand, it’s time to step back and ask, “Are we in the right Market Type?”</p>
<p class="ind" id="page204">Some signs that you’re ready to move forward are positive answers to questions like these: Do sales go up as demand creation efforts become more effective? Are competitors beginning to take notice or even starting to copy your positioning? Does the financial model still work? If the answers are yes, you get to look yourself and your staff in the eye for the most personally trying part of the entire Customer Development process: building the company.</p>
