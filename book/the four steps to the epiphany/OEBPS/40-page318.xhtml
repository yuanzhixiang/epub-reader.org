<p class="noind20"><i>Goal of Phase 3c:</i> Start with your original customer list and expand it to include 5 new potential customers. Now go back to those customers who were nice enough to talk to you as well as new prospects and <i>test your understanding of their needs as well as your product idea.</i> You are still not selling in this phase, you are trying to learn and understand. You want to see if your product meets a current or perceived need.</p>
