<p class="noind20"><i>Goal of Phase 4a:</i> You’ve gone all around the circle. You talked to 5 or 10 customers and <i>listened to how customers worked.</i> Then you went back, developed a problem presentation and talked to another 5 to 10 customers to see if your understanding of their problem, alternatives to solve it, and $’s to solve it was correct.</p>
