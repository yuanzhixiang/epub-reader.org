<p class="noind20"><i>Phase 1f Exit Criteria:</i> Engineering delivers release schedule and feature list. Engineering agrees the goal is to get a product in a paying customer’s hand for customer feedback. All agree that sales to visionaries can be supported by release schedule. Review sales collateral and presentations to ensure they match features and schedules. Agree on sales support, pricing, integration and support.</p>
