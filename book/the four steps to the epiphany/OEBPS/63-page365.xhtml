<p class="noind20"><i>Goal of Phase 4e:</i> This is either the beginning of the end or more than likely just the end of the beginning. You’ve put a stake in the ground of the vision, preliminary first market and willing customers identified, product and pricing validated by potential customers, and a base of <i>potential</i> first visionary sales prospects. Were you right or do you need to talk to more people?</p>

		<li>Can you deliver or did you just sell vaporware?</li>
		<li>If vaporware, at best the company secured a few pilot projects, but as schedules slip, a visionary’s position in his company weakens and support is withdrawn. No usable reference is gained. Solution is to shut down selling, admit mistakes, and turn pilot projects into something useful - first for the customer and then as a marketable product.</li>
