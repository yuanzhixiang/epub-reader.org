<h2 id="head-2-69">Overview</h2>
<p id="c29-para-0022">We have thus far discussed product vision, strategy, and business objectives. In truth, as an early stage startup, you can survive without any of these for a while. It's amazing how far you can get by focusing on meeting the needs of some early customers.</p>
<p id="c29-para-0023">However, the need for this vision and business‐objective context becomes truly serious at scale.</p>
<p id="c29-para-0024">Keeping a small number of teams and their engineers doing useful stuff is not very hard, but getting good results out of a medium—or, especially, large—organization can be truly challenging.</p>
<p id="c29-para-0025">Realize also that by the time the company has scaled, the original co‐founders may have moved on, so there may very well be a void. Teams need this context. It is nearly impossible for them to make good decisions and do good work without it.</p>
<p id="c29-para-0026">The main ways these issues show up is diminished morale, lack of innovation, and reduced velocity.</p>
