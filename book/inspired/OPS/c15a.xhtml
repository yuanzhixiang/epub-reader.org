<h2 id="head-2-40">Overview</h2>
<p id="c15-para-0017">Most companies know that they need to double down on their efforts to recruit very strong staff as they grow, but they don't always know what other changes are important as they grow and scale.</p>
<p id="c15-para-0018">What are the changes in the leadership roles? How do we maintain the holistic view of product when we have many teams? How do we keep teams feeling empowered and autonomous when they just own a small part of the whole? How do we encourage accountability when the only person that owns everything is the CEO? How do we deal with the explosion of dependencies?</p>
<p id="c15-para-0019">These are the topics we will tackle as we discuss how strong product organizations scale.</p>
