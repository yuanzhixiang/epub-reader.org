<h2 id="head-2-89">Overview</h2>
<p id="c37-para-0028">Now that we've framed our discovery work, we're ready to jump in and start figuring out solutions. For complicated product efforts, it often helps to have some way to scope out and plan your discovery efforts.</p>
<p id="c37-para-0029">In this section, I describe two of my favorite discovery‐planning techniques. One is simple (story maps), and the other is fairly complicated (customer discovery program), but they are both remarkably powerful and effective.</p>
<p id="c37-para-0030">I don't want to scare you away from a technique just because it's a lot of work. I often tell product teams that if they could only pick a single technique, the one I'd<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_192" role="doc-pagebreak" title="192"/> recommend is the customer discovery program. Yes, it's a lot of time and effort—especially on the shoulders of the product manager—but it's my favorite leading indicator of future success. I attribute much of the success in my own career to this technique.</p>
