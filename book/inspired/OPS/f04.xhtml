<p id="ffirs01-para-0001"><i>This book is dedicated to my father, Carl Cagan. In 1969, he received the first PhD in computer science in the United States (prior to that computer science was part of electrical engineering programs), and he authored the first book on databases (</i>Data Management Systems<i>, in 1973, also by John Wiley &amp; Sons).</i></p>
<p id="ffirs01-para-0002"><i>In addition to being a terrific father, he taught me to program a computer when I was nine years old—decades before this became a thing—and he instilled in me a love of technology when so many of the technologies we depend on today were just being conceived.</i></p>
