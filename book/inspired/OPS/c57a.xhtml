<h2 id="head-2-141">Overview</h2>
<p id="c57-para-0019">So far, we've been discussing techniques for discovering successful products. But it's important to acknowledge that getting product teams and companies to apply the new techniques and work differently is often easier said than done.</p>
<p id="c57-para-0020">Partly this is because people are people. But mainly it's hard because the changes are so often cultural.</p>
<p id="c57-para-0021">As a very explicit example, moving from mercenary‐style, product roadmap‐driven, output‐focused teams, to truly empowered, accountable product teams that are measured by business results, represents a major cultural shift and a substantial handoff of power and control from management to the individuals on the teams.</p>

<p id="c57-para-0023">Fortunately, there are techniques that can help the organization through this.</p>
